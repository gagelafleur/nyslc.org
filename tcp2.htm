                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In 1991, 
                Dale Davis, Executive Director of The New York State Literary 
                Center (NYSLC), was invited to design and conduct a writing 
                project at a “last stop” program for high school students 
                struggling with severe learning, behavioral, social, and 
                emotional needs. Prior to the project, the students were 
                reluctant to put any words on paper.&nbsp; Through The NYSLC, Davis 
                published a book, Just Give Us A Chance, of the tremendous 
                amount of writing by the students generated during the project.</span></p>

                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In 1994, 
                Davis created an installation with the writing of&nbsp; the students 
                from the &quot;last stop&quot; program&nbsp; for The American Council on The 
                Arts in New York. The installation attracted the attention of 
                media critic, Jon Katz who wrote an article on the installation 
                and Davis’ work for New York Magazine. The article generated a 
                tremendous number of orders for the books of writing by the 
                students. The need for NYSLC publications both in education and 
                for rehabilitation was clearly demonstrated through the number 
                of orders.</span></p>

                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Publication 
                of excerpts from the books in newspapers throughout the country 
                brought additional attention. The books were selected for 
                inclusion in the ERIC Clearinghouse on urban Education (ERIC/CU) 
                of Teachers College, Columbia University. In November of 1994, 
                Dale Davis wrote an Op-Ed Column for The New York Times on the 
                students and their writing.</span></p>

                service for journalists to inform the public about children’s’

                an example of the type of project for youth at-risk that is 
                promoted by The President’s Committee on the Arts and 
                Humanities. A student’s writing was featured on the website, 
                both as a hook for journalists and as an example of how to write 
                a story. The student’s book, Black Men, was published by The 
                NYSLC and made available through Amazon.com. In 2005, THE 
                COMMUNICATION PROJECT began an ongoing collaboration with 
                Pacific News Service’s The Beat Within. In 2005, writing by 
                students in the Rochester City School District’s Youth and 
                Justice Programs at the Monroe Correctional Facility was

                Davis produced a CD of students in residential placement reading 
                and performing their writing as a way to develop reading and 
                writing skills. Davis saw producing a CD as another opportunity 
                to extend the students’ academic knowledge, social skills, and 
                personal behaviors. Young Souls Speaking was the first CD she 
                recorded and produced. It was produced as a NYSLC pilot program. 
                The pilot was extremely successful. Adolescents with low reading 
                skills who refused to read aloud became comfortable reading and 
                performing their writing by the time they went to the recording 
                studio. </span></p>

                intellectual abilities of high-risk young people by providing 
                them with the tools necessary to construct meaning in their 
                lives and in their academic tasks. THE COMMUNICATION PROJECT 
                connects adolescents to positive values to provide them with the 
                opportunity to actively respond to events, rather than to 
                passively react to them. THE COMMUNICATION PROJECT makes the 
                connections between what is learned in school and the students’ 
                lives. THE COMMUNICATION PROJECT is the bridge from the rhyme 
                book to the classroom.</span></p>
