				<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">From 
				discrimination, the underground railroad, Rochester history, 
				Rochester being the second home for Frederick Douglass, what I 
				would like to say to you who observe this mural is that this is 
				more than a piece of artwork. This mural brought young men in 
				Monroe Correctional Facility together. We put our differences 
				aside, such as the hoods we are from. The great thing about 
				working on this mural is that you don’t see this very often 
				these days.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The crazy thing 
				is back then it used to be about us as people. Today everyone 
				plays themselves all across the globe. Working on the mural was 
				united we stand, divided we fall. We stood and the result of our 
				standing is presented to you in this mural.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I hope you will 
				take it for what it is and relate it to your own life. 
				Acknowledge just how far we have come as a community and think 
				if we work together how far we can go. It’s not about what the 
				world can do for me, but what can I do for the world. Pretty 
				much this is what working on this mural opened my eyes to.</span></p>

				During the time I worked on the mural I learned more than I

				that Frederick Douglass actually published his own newspaper, 
				The North Star, and the office was in downtown Rochester. I was 
				surprised to learn Frederick Douglass home schooled his 
				children. I found great inspiration in what I learned. </span>
