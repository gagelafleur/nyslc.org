          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In the eleventh year, 2016 - 2017, NYSLC chose the name <strong>The Community Engagement Seminar</strong> for its Incarcerated Education Program classes at Monroe Correctional Facility. The goals of NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program were to make education relevant, to introduce different ideas and perspectives, and to enlarge the view of the community for those incarcerated. The name <strong>Community Engagement Seminar</strong> related directly to the goals.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This seminar is the education needed in the correctional facility. It helps us to get an education and to find ourselves. We all have dreams and goals. This seminar helps us find those dreams. Education is the key to progressing in life, to not coming back here, to be productive, and to help young kids growing up.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I like the Community Engagement Seminar because it gives meaning and makes all of us feel wanted and accepted. Plus, we are learning, and we all feel happy about this. The seminar is teaching us to think and read and write and this makes us want to go further in our education.</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><strong>The Community Engagement Seminar</strong> began with a screening of <strong>"Echoes of Incarceration"</strong> <a href = "http://echoesofincarceration.org/Home.html"  style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">http://echoesofincarceration.org/Home.html</a>, &nbsp;an award-winning documentary initiative produced by youth with incarcerated parents. The documentary explored the issue of mass incarceration and its effects on families. It was produced by Ibis Productions, Brooklyn, New York an organization that creates documentary films told from the life experiences of the filmmakers themselves.</font></span></p>

          a shell of a man,<br />
          wondering what to say<br />
          for you to understand.<br />
          If only I could turn back time,<br />
          My life would be different.<br />
          My actions were not those of a father.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Is it too late? Should I even bother?<br />
          You need to understand my child I love you.<br />

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I just hope you understand I love all so much. I admit I am the worst at controlling my anger, but all this stress in my life has been making me go nuts.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">It is hard for me to express to you how ashamed I feel. You are my six kids, I am pushing fifty, and I am sitting in jail. It hurts to be a disappointment to you, to all of you that I love.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Brett</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I am writing you this letter to try to explain how greatly sorry I am for being in jail while you guys are growing up. I just want to tell you guys that it is nothing you ever did or said either. I never realized I was so bad until the time I got locked up. I have been struggling with alcoholism for a lot of years now.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I think what I did was from my ego. I did what a lot of what people were expecting, even knowing it was wrong. Instead of saying no I did what was in front of me. I was easily convinced into choosing alcohol over my family. I let alcohol, drugs, and jail get in the way of being the best father I could be to you guys, the father you guys deserve. I was not there financially or mentally for you guys due to my addiction and incarcerations. I missed holidays, birthdays, school, and family functions as well. I will never be able to get them back, and I feel horrible about this.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Due to all of my addictions and failure to get the help I needed, I managed to lose our family, and I am sorry for that as well. I just hope I can take the skills I am gaining in jail this time and when I am released convert them into life in the real world.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">All I want is for you boys to be happy financially, mentally, and physically. I hope to kick this addiction out of the door and be the father you guys deserve. I am truly sorry, and I hope you guys can forgive me. I love you more than words can say.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">"Echoes of Incarceration" &nbsp;was followed by a screening of "<strong>First Degree</strong>," a film produced by Roger Weisberg on can college behind bars stop the revolving door <a href="http://www.pppdocs.com/firstdegree.html" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">http://www.pppdocs.com/firstdegree.html</a>?</font></span></p>

          <img style="max-width:750px;" src = "images/history16_2.png" />

          </font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The film generated much discussion about what was offered at Monroe Correctional Facility and does it stop the revolving door. The participants in the seminar put their thoughts into writing.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The film <strong>First Degree</strong> was very emotional and inspirational to me, and I hope to others as well. It shows how the judicial system is all messed up. It shows that incarceration would rather pay for food, clothing, and shelter than to pay for our education while we are confined. The system is broken.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><strong>First Degree</strong> shows how education is very important for me and for other incarcerated men. When I am released from these mental and physical shackles, I am going to tell my grandkids and nephews and nieces that yes minds do matter especially those of Black incarcerated men who cannot vote due to a felony conviction. I want to tell them about how incarceration has changed my life, and without any form of education we are realizing the revolving door scenario.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I would like to be able to look back and know that I have saved a young life from being a statistic. We who are incarcerated want to do something with our lives and not go in and out of a penitentiary. When I think about <strong>First Degree</strong> it makes me think about myself and all of the mistakes I have made in my life. The United States has the highest rate of incarceration. Russia is second. We need to stop spending money on unnecessary things that will not reduce the incarceration rate and spend it on education for inmates.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Jovontae</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">What I would like to learn more about is education helping incarcerated men and women not come back to jail and move forward with their lives. The film <strong>First Degree</strong> showed me how getting an education gives you a greater chance of not repeating crimes over and over again because you learn something you care about.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><strong>First Degree</strong> was inspirational to me in many ways. It definitely showed that the justice system is broken, and how much education would benefit us and lower the recidivism rate. Hopefully this could be incorporated into county jails someday because it would stop us from repeating the same crimes over and over. I would love to look back one day and be able to talk to young adults about not making the same mistake I did when I was younger. I would like incarceration to change life for the better and instead of making better criminals make productive members of society. I believe it would help those incarcerated tremendously to be able to get a college credits while incarcerated in a county jail or a state prison.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">What I have been writing explains a lot about how I feel about the justice system and my education and how the education system and teachers could have pushed me harder like they did other students. I feel like I was cheated especially when it comes to my education. I, also, feel I cheated myself by not applying myself more in my schoolwork. As for what I write about it's got a lot to do with what I value and what is important to me in life.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I really don't know where I belong in the world right now. One thing I do know is that I have a meaning or purpose in the world. What it is I don't know yet.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The world I live in could be more aware of helping those less fortunate in it, help all of us to succeed and reach our goals. I want to go to college badly but deep down inside I'm scared. I want to succeed but failure is a big fear for me. It hurts to fail. I need a college to help me one on one.</font></span></p>
