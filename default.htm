													Don't let our dreams die in jail. This is what we live and fight for in here. We struggle for our dreams. When you are incarcerated you live day by day. We write to be heard, not ignored. Read what we have to say. All we have in here is

													Incarceration: Its Impact on Children and Families
												</div>

												<p class="">In 2014, NYSLC introduced a new initiative, Rebuilding Families, into its Incarcerated Education Program to respond to the impact of incarceration on children and families. Participants in NYSLC's Community Engagement
													Seminar in a county correctional facility read articles, studied research, and wrote from personal experience on the effects of incarceration on families. In response, Rebuilding Families began a pilot partnership with the Rochester
													Broadway Theater League (RBTL). John Parkhurst of RBTL visited the Seminar and presented information about RBTL and the musicals Seminar participants would be invited to attend with their families upon their release. Once they were
													released, participants were given tickets and transportation to attend the Broadway musicals with their families <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/joseph.htm">https://www.nyslc.org/joseph.htm</a>, <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/matilda.htm">https://www.nyslc.org/matilda.htm</a>.</p>

												<p>The voices, experiences, and success of the pilot led to a four-year partnership with the RBTL, a connection with another of Rochester's cultural resources, and a video:</p>

												<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qixmh1pQBsk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

												<p>In the Community Engagement Seminar participants continued to read, write, and reflect on the challenges and stresses they and their children faced. This led to NYSLC's identifying children of incarcerated parents as a challenge that
													was largely unaddressed in the community. Incarceration fractured Rochester families. In a family where a parent is incarcerated, the impact on a family is traumatic. Parents do not serve sentences alone. Research showed children often
													lose contact with their parents and visits can be rare. Children, also, were more likely to drop out of school, engage in delinquent behavior, and later become incarcerated themselves. Incarceration had a lasting impact on a child's
													well-being, health, and behavior, causing stress on relationships, emotional and mental strain, and financial hardships.</p>

												<p class="quote">"These children are the invisible victims of the criminal justice system. They are going through a loss similar perhaps to having a parent in the military, but instead of the community rallying around them, they often
													feel like they have to keep it a secret.</p>

												<p class="quote">"People rarely see the issue through the child's perspective. Who knows if there's parents who don't deserve to have kids in or out of prison. But I haven't met a kid who doesn't deserve to have a parent.'"</p>

												<p class="quote"><em>Nell Bernstein. All Alone in The World, Children of The Incarcerated. New York: The New Press, 2005.</em></p>

												<p>Throughout the four years, the documentary "Echoes of Incarceration," an award-winning documentary produced by youth with incarcerated parents, was screened. The documentary explores the issue of mass incarceration and its effects on
													families told from the life experiences of the youth themselves. The effect was tremendous.</p>

												<p class="quote">As I watched the documentary, the words echoed encouragement, and love, unconditional love. Seeing how much these kids still love their parents, unconditionally after their parents' missteps, and never turning their
													backs on their parents encouraged me that I can reconnect with my children, that it's not too late, and there is always hope.</p>

												<p class="quote"><em>T.D.</em></p>

												<p>Rebuilding Families continued to move forward with continuous input from all participants on the challenges and stresses they and their children faced.</p>

												<p class="quote">This is helping me to step up and become a better father for my kids.</p>

												<p class="quote"><em>T.</em></p>

												<p class="quote">Thank God for a program like this. It gives me a chance to share how I feel, my true feelings, not feelings of anger because I feel like a failure. I love my children more than life itself. Now I finally have a chance to
													give something to them to show them. It feels great to know there are still people who care in the world. Thank God.</p>

												<p class="quote"><em>A.</em></p>

												<p class="quote">I feel this program is the most positive way to reconnect broken families. If there were more of these programs, there would be more understanding of the need to reconnect broken families. People need to understand there
													are people who fall short of what they really want to happen in their lives. They have feelings, and it's hard to show them. This program gives us a chance to express ourselves to our children.</p>

												<p class="quote"><em>J.</em></p>

												<p>NYSLC is a small arts organization. The initial four years of Rebuilding Families looked at the effect of incarceration on families and challenged a small arts organization to respond to what NYSLC learned from teaching those in the
													Seminar. In 2019, participants in the Seminar suggested the creation of a space to compile and house resources, research, and information, an accessible space on how incarceration impacts families, and reach out to incarcerated parents,
													children, educators, schools, and cultural organizations on the burdens faced by children.</p>

												<p>Rebuilding Families was initiated to reduce the impact of incarceration for children and families. There is no road map. NYSLC is creating a space on <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/">https://www.nyslc.org/</a>:</p>

												<ul>
													<li>To connect to the latest research on the effects of parental incarceration on families and children;</li>
													<li>To introduce innovative approaches to teaching and learning in education for children whose parents are incarcerated;</li>
													<li>To share successful national programs, documentaries, and websites;</li>
													<li>To post books by families dealing with incarceration;</li>
													<li>To post writing by incarcerated parents and children whose parents are incarcerated;</li>
												</ul>

												<p>NYSLC is actively working to raise awareness that having a parent who is incarcerated is an additional risk factor for a child who is an unrecognized, innocent victim and has done nothing.</p>

					<p style="font-size: 10.0pt;font-family: Arial,sans-serif;margin-bottom:20px; ">
						Since 2005 the New York State Literary Center's focus has been on the arts integrated into incarcerated education in Monroe County. NYSLC's <strong>Incarcerated Education Program</strong> concentrates on adults incarcerated for a county year or under at Monroe Correctional Facility. This emphasis grew directly from NYSLC's history, experience, on going research, low literacy levels, recidivism, the disconnect from any sense of community, the consequences of incarceration for children whose parents are incarcerated, and the lack of information on the effectiveness of short-term arts programs in jails and correctional facilities.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 10.0pt;font-family: Arial,sans-serif;margin-bottom:20px; ">
					NYSLC's <strong>Incarcerated Education Program</strong> has three components: <strong>The Community Engagement Seminar, Rebuilding Families</strong>, and <strong>Theater</strong>. <strong>COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SEMINAR</strong> participants read, report, discuss, and write on history and issues they identify as important. Readings include poetry, history, identity, first person narratives, studies and research on children of incarcerated parents, the affects of parental incarceration on a child's education, poverty in Rochester, college and job-hunting with a criminal record.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 10.0pt;font-family: Arial,sans-serif;margin-bottom:20px; ">
					NYSLC identified the children of those incarcerated as a community need that was not being met. Rochester parents serving sentences of one year or under at Monroe Correctional Facility do not suffer the consequences alone; children often lose contact with their parents and many times visits are rare. Research has shown children of incarcerated parents are more likely to drop out of school, engage in delinquent behavior, and subsequently be incarcerated themselves. The separation of incarceration causes stress on relationships, emotional and mental strain and financial hardships that can leave a lasting impact on a child. In 2014, NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program partnered with the Rochester Broadway Theater League in <strong>REBUILDING FAMILIES</strong>, to rebuild and reaffirm the family for incarcerated parents and to reduce the impact of incarceration for their children.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 10.0pt;font-family: Arial,sans-serif;margin-bottom:20px; ">
					<strong>THEATER</strong>, adapted from the writing of those incarcerated with a strong historical component, has always been an important part of NYSLC's work, from the history of Rochester, to the voices of adolescents incarcerated as adults on their own "school to prison pipeline," "Where We Have Been: 1964," to "Reading James Baldwin 2015," performed at Monroe Correctional Facility in July 2015.
