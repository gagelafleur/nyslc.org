I have learned that there is really no such thing as good friends. Being locked is one of the closest things to death, out of sight out of mind. You learn to kind of look at everybody with contempt. You no longer look at relationships the same way. Personally I will no longer waste my time on those who are going nowhere and do not cherish their freedom. It is the relationships I have had that have led me to some degree to being incarcerated in here on this Christmas. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c2">I live and learn. I have learned I do not want to waste my time with fake friends, and I do not want to make excuses for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">WHY I SHOULD BE ACCEPTED INTO COLLEGE</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">J. H.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">My life? I have gone through a lot of struggles that caused me to be on my own at an age younger than most people. &nbsp;I grew up as a bi-racial child which brought with it identity issues that I had to overcome. I felt as though I did not belong in any group. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The problems began when my mother&rsquo;s boyfriend, our baby sitter, was angry with my mother and burned me with scalding water. I received third degree burns. My mom never forgave herself and became over protective, which caused me not to grow up like regular kids. In addition when I was eleven my father died. My mom started dating one of his friends and that caused a fallout between us. I started to get kicked out of my home. &nbsp;I was not allowed to eat there or stay there, so I started to live on the streets. I was homeless from the time I was fourteen until I was eighteen. At eighteen I got an apartment and started to pay my own bills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">All of the time I was on my own I had a special interest in global history and travelling. I studied a lot of history and did a lot of research for facts. I have such a big fascination with the world outside of the United States. I keep up with world news and how it affects things around us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I went to Monroe Community College and did not graduate due to my instability. I lost my job because my contract ended. I was encouraged by a teacher to attend MCC and to pursue my passion of studying the world around me. I hoped the degree would open the door to job, which required me to travel. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I have been able to work at some wonderful jobs from tech support to fast food to sales to hard labor. I was able to travel around the country and do sales in different states. I am sincerely trying to find out who I am. I do know that I still like to travel, and I still love history. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I realize that an education is important because I know you cannot get far without one. I want an education to open doors that I am unable to open myself. I don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in certain positions for my whole life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I believe that I have truly learned from my mistakes. I wish I had taken college more seriously. Given the opportunity to attend I know I will succeed because I want to succeed now, and I want to go above and beyond. I want a college education to elevate my life. I want to help others who want to succeed also. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Thank you for reading this and giving me the opportunity to tell you about myself and why a college education means so much to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c5"><span class="c4">WE NEED HELP</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">W.

It was a study on the effects of incarceration on children. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Nationally the number of kids who have had a parent in jail or prison at some point in their childhood is around 5.1 million and this is a conservative estimate (Anna E. Casey Foundation, 2016). I know children are never the same with a parent in jail. I know this because it affects my children. I wish I could take back what I did, but I can&rsquo;t and my kids suffer from it. Why can&rsquo;t there be a program to help us get time off of our sentences so we could go home to our kids faster? Can you give us jobs to take days off our time? This would help so many of us get back home to our kids. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">We need help. I am writing this for every inmate who wants to be with his/her children and family. We need this type of program. Our kids need this type of program. Who can help us and &nbsp; create a program where work would take time off our sentences? This is what I ask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">MY DREAMS FOR MY TWO CHILDREN</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">K.

I want you to know that you can accomplish anything you put your mind to. I want you to know my son that you have endless support from your daddy. I am your life coach.

Lack of finances is lack of counsel. As a result we are housed on a small rack no wider than a coffin.

It was never designed for me to be great, whatever great even is. One thing I do know is I have to have a purpose if not then my whole life is just idle time recreation. I would rather set life changing trends in order to give people like me a leg up in life. The way I learned prison is not a place I want to be was by going to prison. I never knew how much it hurt to be shot or stabbed until it happened.

I have always hated those feelings and thoughts, but after awhile they just became natural. After so many years of being hurt, lost, let down, beaten, abused, and looked down upon I put my feet down and I am making life changes. I am starting to find myself. I have forgiven, but I will never forget. I am stronger now and more determined to find my purpose and to find the beauty in life itself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&copy; New York State Literary Center 2019</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><div><p class="c19"><span class="c14 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c14"></span></p></div></div>
