				initiated discussion about establishing a task force to create a

				Suggested areas within the handbook included identifying 
				different types of facilities and their unique contextual

				teaching in an incarcerated facility, resources for learning in 
				and through the arts within classrooms. The following signed up 
				to participate in the task force: Nelli Bespalova, Carol Brown,

				Theresa McIntyre, Donielle Rome, Dwight Stecker. Dale Davis will

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dwight

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dale Davis 
				reported that progress is being made on “intellectual property,” 
				copyright, trademark, and the rights of inmates in relation to 
				artwork and writing. The New York State Literary Center, through 
				the Arts &amp; Cultural Council of Greater Rochester, has secured 
				the pro bono legal services of Nixon Peabody. Dale Davis and 
				Edward Ignarri have met with attorney Wendell Harris of Nixon 
				Peabody. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dale Davis 
				proposed a possible publication on the Arts in Correctional 
				Education with Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative. Amy Swauger, 
				Executive Director of Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative, is 
				receptive to the idea. John Curtis stressed the lack of research 
				on the education of juveniles in detention and adolescents 
				incarcerated as adults and that the publication would be 
				extremely valuable. While the overall theme would be the arts 
				education already in place within the various programs that are 
				part of the network, Dale Davis specifically made editorial 
				suggestions to members about contributions she felt people could 
				and should make. Dale Davis and Sean Turner will spearhead this 
				effort.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The group 
				discussed potential research projects and the need for further 
				research. A larger question arose regarding what is going to be 
				examined as a variable: Would this be “art therapy”, “learning 
				in and through the arts,” “arts instruction”, or “arts based 
				projects”. While the group accepted the following Dependent 
				Variables (incidents, learning, recidivism rates), the group 
				still needs to decide which of these, if any, would be included 
				in the guidebook / handbook, the proposed publication and which 
				could potentially be identified as part of training or as an 
				intervention, or as a basis for a larger grant, including a U. 
				S. Department of Education grant.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Discussion 
				included pulling from existing research that has examined the 
				use of arts education with at-risk students (including learning 
				in and through the arts and arts instruction) and deciding if 
				this would serve as a foundation for the group to pursue larger 
				funded projects, or if the group would examine issues not 
				addressed within the larger set of literature already published, 
				and unique to incarcerated facilities.&nbsp; </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Further 
				discussion included how this research might tie into a similar 
				grant that was received by the Coalition of Arts for 
				Court-Involved Youth in Massachusetts, wherein the variable of 
				arts infusion was measured on youth development, learning, and 
				transition of incarcerated youth from incarceration into the 
				mainstream community. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Final 
				discussion about research included the potential to evaluate the 
				effect of a said intervention (once the variable is identified) 
				within three facilities in New York State, including Monroe 
				County Jail, Island Academy, and Passages Academy. Sean Turner 
				is addressing this. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Theresa 
				McIntyre spoke about the NYS Association of Incarcerated 
				Education Programs (NYSAIEP) conference in Saratoga on May 5&nbsp; - 
				8, 2009. The theme of this year’s conference is “The Arts, 
				Literacy, and Correctional Education.”&nbsp; NYSACEN will work with 
				NYSAIEP on the conference. Everyone in attendance indicated 
				support for participation in the conference. Dale Davis and 
				Theresa McIntyre will work on the collaboration.</span></p>

				Gary Dayton identified four areas that NYSACEN should focus on: 
				Partnerships (long and sustainable); Arts Based Learning; 
				Continued improvement; and Development of learning communities).
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jackson 
				Taylor identified a need to examine how the arts raised the 
				level of skill.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Frank Dody 
				identified the need to address the problem of “isolated efforts” 
				by “putting our heads together on a joint art project. Others 
				joined in on this point, by noting that there should spaces to 
				continue the dialogue between artists and teachers, including 
				sharing pedagogical practices, reflective narratives, and types 
				of art practices used.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">John Curtis 
				and Sydney Blair identified that there is a need to look at what 
				types of measures we use to evaluate the effectiveness of our 
				arts-based programs.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dale Davis 
				identified that there is a need to develop a manual or written 
				framework for teacher training (for collaboration in an arts 
				based learning project in an incarcerated facility) and for 
				shaping an effective partnership between an educational provider 
				and an arts and / or cultural organization; for identifying 
				elements that an artist and arts and cultural organizations 
				should know before beginning work with and in a correctional 
				education program.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">John Curtis, 
				Frank Dody, and Sydney Blair clearly highlighted the need to 
				further define both our group and our population. In particular 
				they highlighted the significance of bringing together 
				educators, representing mandated school programs taking place 
				within incarcerated facilities and secure detention centers, 
				artists, representing a diverse network of arts and cultural 
				organizations that have partnered with these schools, and 
				representatives of community based arts and / or cultural 
				organizations that have developed spaces for this population to 
				continue their arts based learning outside of incarcerated 
				facilities and secure detention centers. In addition, they noted 
				that the student population that we work with is not represented 
				in much of the “discussion” about using arts in jails, because, 
				in part, of the transitional nature of our student population, 
				the age range (8-19) of the student population, which requires 
				educational services that address state and No Child Left Behind 
				mandates, and because of the correlation of the student 
				population and previous academic failure (as evident in the low 
				reading scores, lack of promotional criteria being met). They 
				also not noted there was little or no research done on this 
				population. </span></p>

				Implications.&nbsp; </span></i>
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As a result 
				of this discussion, I have three major areas in which this group 
				could initiate further inquiry (research) or development 
				(collaboration):</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arts

				<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="A">
					<li class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
					development of a “teacher manual” for artists, teachers, and 
					arts and cultural organizations to use for working in a 
					secure facility, specific to arts based learning activities;</span></li>
				</ol>
				<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="2" type="A">
					<li class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
					Identification of effective types of art practices, skills, 
					pedagogies and instructional strategies that are currently 
					being used within arts based activities taking place inside 
					secure facilities;</span></li>
				</ol>
				<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="3" type="A">
					<li class="MsoNormal">

					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Examples

				</ol>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">While most 
				of this development could be done by each organization/school 
				providing their own data, there still appears to be a need for 
				one person to observe different activities across sites, and 
				complete teacher and student interviews. The latter of which is 
				specific for identifying types of art practices used by students 
				and which could be used for further development of a 
				template/rubric/evaluation used across sites.&nbsp;</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Impact 
				of arts based learning and instruction upon incarcerated and/or 
				pre-adjudicated populations. This would include further inquiry 
				into the effect of art based learning on incarcerated youth, as 
				noted by the following measures: </span></p>

				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As noted 
				within our discussion, there is general agreement that arts 
				based learning enhances student learning in the classrooms while 
				decreasing the amount of student aggression (physical and verbal 
				incidents), but it remains to be seen just what this means&nbsp; As 
				such, we should be able to develop a common framework for an 
				arts based activity that could be used as an intervention at 
				three incarcerated facilities across the state, and look at the 
				effect of this intervention upon student behavior and learning 
				before, during and after the activity.&nbsp; An additional design 
				would be used to examine if students, who took part in the 
				activity, were able to make a successful transition back into a
