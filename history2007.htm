          The Jimmy Santiago Boca Library, Writing, and Publishing Center was established by the New York State Literary Center on the 5th

          art supplies, and books and periodicals relevant to the lives of the incarcerated youth were purchased with a grant from a private
          foundation. Incarcerated youth were selected to work in The Jimmy Santiago Boca Library, Writing, and Publishing Center through a
          rubric developed by <strong>Dale Davis</strong> and Rochester City School District teachers with sheriff's deputies.

          Incarcerated youth at Monroe County Jail worked with <strong>Dale Davis</strong> to create a play, "Where Is Tomorrow Coming From," that
          juxtaposed Rochester history with present day Rochester. The play emanated from the fact that Monroe County Jail sits on the
          one hundred acres of land originally purchased by Colonel Nathaniel Rochester <a href = "https://www.nyslc.org/tomorrowfrom.htm" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.nyslc.org/tomorrowfrom.htm.</a>
          Director and actor <strong>David Shakes</strong> cast, rehearsed, and directed the play performed by incarcerated youth for students / inmates,
          sheriff's deputies, teachers, and invited members from the community.
