				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Born in New
				Mexico of Indio-Mexican descent, <b>Jimmy Santiago Baca</b> was
				raised first by his grandmother and later sent to an orphanage.
				A runaway at age 13, it was after Baca was sentenced to five
				years in a maximum security prison that he began to turn his
				life around: he learned to read and write and unearthed a
				voracious passion for poetry.&nbsp; Instead of becoming a hardened
				criminal, he emerged from prison a writer. <i>Immigrants in Our
				Own Land </i>was published in 1979, the year he was released
				from prison. He earned his GED later that same year. He is the
				winner of the Pushcart Prize, the American Book Award, the
				International Hispanic Heritage Award and for his memoir <i>A
				Place to Stand</i> the prestigious International Award. In 2006
				he won the Cornelius P. Turner Award. The national award
				recognizes one GED graduate a year who has made outstanding
				contributions to society in education, justice, health, public
				service and social welfare. Baca has devoted his post-prison
				life to writing and teaching others who are overcoming hardship.

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I am
				introducing myself and my writing. I want you, the reader, to
				know how Ms. Dale Davis' poetry class opened my mind and also my
				heart on paper. Working here in The Jimmy Santiago Baca Library,
				Writing, and Publishing Center furthered my writing and reading
				skills. My poetry is mainly about my life and what I've been
				through and what I have felt as a teenager on the cold streets
				of Rochester. As I've been writing and putting my thoughts on
				paper, I've seen where I went wrong. This poetry class has
				changed my whole demeanor as a young man. I feel like a
				caterpillar waiting to sprout to a butterfly on a hot, sunny
				day. My life has been rough like a rock skipping across the
				ocean, not in my home but on the streets. As I was growing up,
				my intentions were to be a general, constructing an army,
				because I was always told never to be a follower. In my heart, I
				was only trying to have the world and everything in it like
				cars, money etc. Now I can see I was reaching for something that
				can't be reached. It was going to only end with death or prison
				time.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Many of us
				die, many of us go to prison, but few of us make it. My two
				years of being incarcerated has given me a new outlook on the
				crimes I used to do that didn't amount to anything. Now I'm
				taking this time to get my mind and body right so when I get
				released I can further my education and do right by my family. I
				want to be one of the examples of the black man who has broken
				the tradition and changed his life around. I don't want to come
				back to the white man's prison and live under his rules. I've
				marked my mistakes, and I have learned from them. </span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As I was
				growing up in the poverty-stricken streets of Rochester, NY,
				adults always told me I had a marvelous gift. Although I've
				always had a hard time looking for my talent and even became
				bewildered at some times trying to find my gift, I always knew
				there was something unique about me; I just needed some help
				finding it. On December 11<sup>th</sup> 2007 I came to Monroe
				County Jail for a felony charge. During my stay downtown there
				were a lot of crucial decisions I contemplated deeply. I had
				four choices to choose form, the legit successful road, prison,
				institutions or 'Death'. Seeing that I wanted to get my life
				together and stay out of the system, I came to the decision that
				I would not let my mistake become a burden in my life. While
				incarcerated I started reading more than ever and I also started
				taking writing classes in The Jimmy Baca Santiago Library with a
				lady named Dale Davis. That class really got me on track and it
				also helped me discover that I had a gift for writing and a
				passion for words. Ever since I first came to the class I have
				put my life on a straight road and now I'm more determined than
				ever to stay on a path of success. Here of some of my pieces of
				work, I hope you like them.</span></p>

				Santiago Baca Library, Writing, and Publishing Center is very
				unique. I have learned a lot about myself, how creative I can be
				and what I am capable of. I think better and can express the way
				I feel about the world, the problems I have, and the life I
				live. There needs to be more rooms just like this so more kids
