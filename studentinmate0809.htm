				Mothers pray every time their kids go outside the house or when
				they are out too late that something has not happened to their

				because there are three floors, and there are a lot of females
				all over that school. The staff really did not stop us from
				running the halls. When a teacher sent us back to class, it was
				like that every time. I looked at Franklin like it was a place
				to go to have fun, and what I mean by fun is play fighting,
				running in the halls, and yelling at the staff. Then they put us
				out of school, and I was happy because I was not in school. My

				could tell her you want to the first one to school. This school

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It seems to
				me that most of the teachers in the city school district don't
				care about any thing but getting through the lesson. They don't
				care about if you get the lesson or of you understand it, only
				if they get through it. In my ideal school, teachers would care
				if you understood the lesson.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Some people
				get long term suspended for simple things such as writing on
				desks and skipping classes. Things like this can ruin their
				lives. In my ideal school, there would be no long-term
				suspension.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I went to
				Thomas Jefferson for three years, to Hillside for one month, and
				to Edison Tech for two years. My favorite school was Edison
				Tech. The reason for this is because when I first arrived at
				Edison my freshman year I was overwhelmed with joy and
				perseverance. It made me feel like whatever I choose to pursue
				as a career I could accomplish there.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">If I could
				design my own school it would be a lot like Edison Tech. I would
				have better teachers though and better authority figures. I
				would test the arriving freshman, not on their academic ability
				but by what their biggest common interests are. Then from that
				test I would place them in classes by what they want to learn to
				make the most of themselves in their careers. There would be
				five to eight students in each class.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I think a
				good school would know that city school kids need things that
				they can relate to. There would be automotive shop for kids who
				like working on cars, and a skilled trade class for kids who
				love to build things and love hands on work, and a technology
				class for kids who love computer things. If schools had things
				city school kids could relate to, kids would believe there was
				something actually there for them to do and learn.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">From
				pre-school to high school, I went to ABC Head start, and then
				from kindergarten to second grade, I went to Number Nine School.
				For third grade I went to Number Twenty-Two School, for fourth
				grade I went to Number 14 School, for fifth grade I traveled
				back to Number Nine School. I graduated and went to Dr. Freddie
				Thomas for sixth and seventh grades. For eighth grade I was I
				went Joseph Villa. Then I was modified to Industry Limited
				Secure and spent my tenth grade year there. That didn't stop. I
				did what I was supposed to to get out, and I went to Hart Street
				to get enrolled back in school. I ended going to Edison School
				of Engineering and Manufacturing. </span></p>

				I got like 2 or 3 ice creams. I was young, what do you expect
				for me to believe in vegetables. My second favorite school was
				Number Nine School, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School. I liked
				it there because I learned a lot. All of the kids I was growing
				up with were in my classes. It was fun to learn with the same
				kids I played with.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">My ideal
				school would be just like Edison because with each school you
				have the basics being taught but you are also learning a trade.
				Education fits into my life because I know without it I would
				have nothing or be nothing. Some kids go to learn, others just
				to be cool. I really don't know what flows through others
				brains, but education to me means learning to build a better for

				is a part of life for both the pupil and the teacher. I would
				hire two to three supervisors for every subject to aid the
				teachers with paperwork, time off, disciplinary issues and

				financially budgeted material. The halls would be separated by
				class and by subject.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">School and
				education fit into my life very loosely. The importance of
				education dissolved with my house structure, my friends and
				hobbies, and extracurricular activities. I was long termed from
				school due to clowning around. I was not contacted until two
				years after I was long termed, and then I was asked, "Why didn't
				you come to school last year?" By that time I fell into the bad
				influences of "teenager hood." Due to the lack of motivation by
				teachers and kids, I felt useless and stopped attending to my

				discarded by the brain.</span></p>
