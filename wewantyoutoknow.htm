				would like you to realize that it is hard for us. When I say
				"us" I mean the whole jail, all jails, prisons, detention
				centers, group homes and everywhere else someone gets locked up.
				It's hard because once you're convicted of a crime it's like
				everyone looks at you differently. They look at you as if your
				skin color was a turquoise green, or as if you had an third eye
				and were of a different species. We don't think it should be
				like that. Just because we've committed crimes it doesn't make
				us bad people. We just made a mistake in life and as everybody
				knows nobody's perfect. By writing this I want to say to you,
				"Everybody makes mistakes in life; it's just that some are
				bigger than others." I would like you, the audience, to walk
				away with a series of thoughts. As you read our poems and listen
				to us, feel our pain and understand where we are coming from.</font></span></p>

				<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">My name is Jamar,
				and I'm an African American male born and raised in Rochester,
				New York. I'm one of a million kids in Rochester who craves
				attention. If you are a child of the Roc you don't get much,
				especially if you're African American. We all just want to be
				recognized. We try so hard to be recognized but we're still not.
				I feel that jobs don't even recognize us. We fill out so many
				applications, but never get a job. This is what draws people to
				sell drugs, and to do things that lead to deaths. When they sell
				drugs, so many people start to recognize them that it makes them
				feel wanted, like they belong. If they were to sit down and
				think, they would probably say I don't want to be recognized for
				this, I want to be a part of history. They don't think because
				where else would they get the attention. </font></span></p>

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
				<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Most kids can't
				get that kind of attention from their parents because the kids
				only have one parent because of a mother or father running out
				on responsibilities or because of divorce. That leads to parents
				having to work two jobs to make sure the bills are taken care
				of, to always have a roof over their heads and food to eat and
				clothes on their backs. When the parent comes home he / she is
				too tired to do anything with the child. Some parents are just
				drug abusers, and they only care about getting high. After that
				the kids go looking around for a place to fit in. They just want
				to feel like they belong. This is just another form of wanting
				attention. </font></span></p>

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
				<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">It doesn't work
				out for some kids because people in Rochester tend to judge
				somebody just by looking at them. They feel it's necessary to
				hang out with people who are just like them. All we want is to
				know that we exist. How can we make it happen? Some kids change
				up who they really are, by changing the way they dress, walk,
				and talk, others turn to selling drugs. Most kids will do
				anything to get attention, but how they do it is not the right
				way. It sometimes seems we have no choice. </font></span></p>

				<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Some of us have
				important things to say, and we want to be heard. But it seems
				like there is nobody who will hear us. So we turn to the next
				thing. We carry around an attitude. We order people around,
				start yelling, and it helps us become heard. We're not saying
				what is really on are minds. Rochester can prevent this from
				happening to more of us. They say the kids of today are going to
				control how a future turns out, so why not help us make our
				future worthwhile. We can start programs that can help the kids
				of Rochester become recognized. The programs can give us jobs,
				make us heard, let us know we exist, and find out some way to
				help the kids that want attention from their parents. Programs
				can help parents find jobs that pay more so they won't have to
				work two jobs and have less time for their kids. There are
				plenty of things that Rochester can do, but there's just nobody
				paying attention, just like nobody pays attention to us. Until
				the children of the Roc feel we are paid attention to, many of
				us will keep turning to where we get it the most. We can't help
				for how good it makes us feel inside. Every kid wants to be
				valued. It feels as if we get more attention when we're doing
				something wrong, but we don't think of it like that so we keep
				doing it. All we want is that feeling inside to be valued, to
				know that we exist, and to know that somebody is paying
				attention to us.</font></span></p>
