				Dale Davis&nbsp; founded The New York State Literary Center (NYSLC) 
				in 1979. NYSLC was one of the first upstate New York arts 
				organizations to send writers into the public schools to teach 
				on a regular basis. In the past thirty-one years, over 300 
				writers and artists have worked with over 32,000 youth in more 
				than 600 different schools that span from rural, suburban, and 
				urban schools to alternative educational settings. &nbsp;</span></p>

				Starting in the early 1980’s, the successful residences became 
				the first step that led Davis to further NYSLC’s mission through 
				comprehensive programs that included visual, media, and theater 
				arts as part of in-depth, long-term, project-based, 
				interdisciplinary arts projects that addressed real, concrete 
				concerns of students and transformed the writing that went on in 
				school from a solitary, mechanical process into vibrant 
				interactive communications. &nbsp;Students wrote about their own 
				experiences and concerns, and the projects drew individual 
				student expression into collective publications, videos, CDs, 
				installations, and events to achieve presence. </span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial; color: black">
				NYSLC’s programs addressed topics ranging from AIDS education, 
				identity, stereotypes, racism, and popular culture. In theater, 
				with the production by a high school of Dale Davis’ play,<i> 
				like we call it home</i>, adapted from the writing of teenagers, 
				NYSLC brought in an audience of over 2000 students, parents, and 
				educators. <i>like we call it home</i>, with a cast of high 
				school students, toured high schools throughout NYS. </span>

				and high school students in a NYSLC program performed William

				youth to positive values and provided them with the opportunity
