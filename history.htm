                          performance in favor of in-depth, long term interdisciplinary projects. NYSLC programs were created as dynamic, culturally responsive environments for learning and creativity.

                          NYSLC collaborated with an on line service for journalists to inform the public about children's' issues. The service's website cited NYSLC as an example of the type of project for youth at-risk that was promoted by The
                          President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Students writing was featured on the website, both as a hook for journalists and as an example of how to write a story. Her installations, combining the writing of young
                          people and her own photographs, have been exhibited in several prominent venues. Davis' work was featured in a cover story in <em>Leadership</em>, published by the Points of Light Foundation, and was the subject of Fighting
                          The Streets with Art and Literature in <em>Education New York</em>.

                          In  the 1990's Davis' belief in all young people led NYSLC's programs to serve youth at the highest risk for educational failure in grades 7 through 12 in alternative schools, day treatment, residential placement, long-term suspension, and juvenile justice facilities through The Communication Project.  In response to the challenges, NYSLC's The Communication Project developed interest-based, student-centered arts learning strategies, integrating arts learning into the research that recommended what most clearly met the unique and individual needs of high risk students to motivate them to succeed and to complete their education.

                          incarcerated as adults. In 2013 the focus shifted to adults incarcerated for a county year or under. Working with incarcerated adults grew directly from NYSLC's history, experience, ongoing research in low literacy levels,
                          recidivism, the disconnect from any sense of community, and the consequences of incarceration for children when a parent is incarcerated. </span></p>

                        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial; color: black">In 2014, NYSLC introduced Rebuilding Families into its Incarcerated Education Program to respond to the impact of incarceration on children
                          and families. Participants in NYSLC's Community Engagement Seminar read articles, studied research, and wrote from personal experience on the effects of incarceration on families. NYSLC began a four partnership with the
                          Rochester Broadway Theater League that enabled Seminar participants to attend a Broadway musical with their families upon their release. </span></p>

                          unrecognized, innocent victim who has done nothing. NYSLC's commitment to literacy, education, and community engagement included the development of communication and expressive skills between parents and children by working
                          with those in <strong>The Community Engagement Seminar</strong> to collaborate and help steer and develop Incarceration: Its Impact on Children and Families, the annotated guide of resources now on the <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/"
