                High school can be a difficult time for many young people, who
                struggle to fit in or keep up with the demands of a variety of
                classes.&nbsp; But for teenagers who have been incarcerated for a
                period of time, integrating back into an educational environment
                where they may not have thrived in the first place is an even
                greater challenge.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                To help young offenders overcome the obstacles they face when
                they return to high school after spending time in a secure
                facility, the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (DYS)
                and the Boston Public Schools (BPS) have launched the Boston
                Success Initiative.&nbsp; Its goal is to ensure that juveniles have a
                smooth and successful journey back into the classroom.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &quot;It's a transition that can be difficult for kids,&quot; said Jan
                Manfredi, a senior program manager for the DYS Education
                Initiative at Commonwealth Corporation, which provides
                educational services to DYS youth.&nbsp; &quot;This provides them with a
                little bit of a cushion.&quot;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                That cushion comes in the form of a transitional school, where
                juveniles who are being released from DYS facilities can go to
                prepare for their return to public high school.&nbsp; It is an
                intermediary step for these kids, providing them with an
                opportunity to catch up to their peers, so that when they enter
                a regular classroom, they won't be too far behind.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                According to Acting DYS Commissioner Edward Dolan, the juveniles
                receive a solid education while they are in the department's
                custody.&nbsp; The Success Initiative is intended to keep them on
                that steady educational track.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &quot;The idea is to invest in the kids to make them a success [while
                they are incarcerated] and to build on that,&quot; said Dolan.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &nbsp;He added that it is not effective to drop them back into a
                public high school in the middle of the year when the school
                might not even be prepared for their return.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                To avoid this from happening, DYS has, for years, collaborated
                with BPS to place teachers at a DYS day reporting center to work
                with kids who are in the process of transitioning back into the
                community.&nbsp; But in the last year, through the Boston Success
                Initiative, that effort has been stepped up and an entire school
                is now dedicated to young offenders who are rejoining the BPS
                system.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &quot;We learned a lot from [earlier] experiences and it got
                translated into a better designed program,&quot; said Dolan.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &nbsp;The Community Transition School opened last month in Roxbury,
                Mass., with the capacity for 25 students.&nbsp; According to Dolan,
                it's a &quot;small, stand-alone structure&quot; that &quot;looks and feels more
                like a school.&quot;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                Staff at the new facility include three teachers, a lead
                teacher, a community field coordinator and a headmaster, said
                Amy Chris Elliott, Senior Coordinator with the BPS Office of
                High School Renewal. She added that, for the next school year,
                an additional teacher and a program director will be hired.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                According to Elliott, there are currently about 19 students at
                the school that DYS and BPS have jointly selected for placement
                there.&nbsp; When they arrive, school staff assess the students to
                determine their academic levels and needs, she said.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                Because of the low student-to-teacher ratio, the kids receive a
                lot of individual attention, which they truly need to help them
                prepare for the public high school they will be returning to,
                Elliott said.&nbsp; What the teachers at the Community Transition
                School aim to do is get the kids on track so that they can
                return to high school at the end of the next quarter or semester
                without missing a beat, she said.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                Dolan added that the whole idea of the Success Initiative is to
                get the students back on a natural school schedule.&nbsp; DYS and BPS
                try to move the students from the transitional school back to
                high school during breaks, between quarters or semesters, so
                that it is not such a drastic shift for the adolescent and it is
                less disruptive for the school.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &quot;We weren't in synch with the other high schools [prior to this
                program],&quot;said Dolan.&nbsp; &quot;We'd take kids that weren't doing well
                in the first place and drop them into high school in the middle
                of November.&quot;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                Now, with the Community Transition School up and running, DYS
                and BPS are on the same page and can time the release of
                students back into the school system so that it benefits all
                parties involved.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &quot;[We decided] we ought to manage that transition back better and
                we ought to have a place where kids can be brought up to speed
                and catch up and get in synch with a conventional school
                setting,&quot; said Dolan.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                Aside from better scheduling the release of young offenders back
                into the school system, the Boston Success Initiative also
                includes a more focused effort on what the best options are for
                the student upon his or her departure from the Community
                Transition School.</span></p>

                Three weeks before a child is going to be heading back to a
                traditional high school, he or she sits down with a transitional
                assessment panel to make decisions about the future, Elliott
                said.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &quot;The panel is comprised of people involved in their lives in a
                real way,&quot; said Elliott.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">

                &nbsp;She added that family members, staff from the school and DYS
                and people from community-based organizations may all sit on the
                panel.&nbsp; Their job is to talk with the teenagers and their
                parents about what they need to be successful in both high
                school and the community.</span></p>

                According to Manfredi, having all of those different people
                sitting around the same table to determine the best course of
                action for the high schooler has been powerful.&nbsp; She said that
                in one case, the plan was for the student to return to a school
                across the city, which would have required him to take two buses
                and a train to get there each morning.</span></p>

                One of the women sitting on the panel from a community
                organization pointed out the potential travel problems, so the

                Manfredi said.&nbsp;</span></p>

                &nbsp;&quot;The plan sounded great until somebody kind-of looked at the
                application of it in reality,&quot; Manfredi said.&nbsp; &quot;We
                short-circuited the plan, but to the kid's advantage.&quot;</span></p>

                Keeping the young person's best interests in mind is the goal of
                the panel and the Success Initiative, as a whole.&nbsp; According to
                Dolan, the desired outcome is for the teenager to succeed and

				Government Invests In&nbsp; Culture of Hip Hop<br>
				</font></b></i><font face="Arial" size="2">March 14, 2007</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SAO PAULO,
				<a title="More news and information about Brazil." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/brazil/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">
				<font color="#000000">Brazil</font></a> " In a classroom at a
				community center near a slum here, a street-smart teacher offers
				a dozen young students tips on how to improve their graffiti
				techniques. One floor below, in a small soundproof studio,
				another instructor is teaching a youthful group of would-be
				rappers how to operate digital recording and video equipment.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is one of Brazil's Culture
				Points, fruit of an official government program that is helping
				to spread hip-hop culture across a vast nation of 185 million
				people. With small grants of $60,000 or so to scores of
				community groups on the outskirts of Brazil's cities, the
				Ministry of Culture hopes to channel what it sees as the latent
				creativity of the country's poor into new forms of expression.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The program, conceived in 2003,
				is an initiative of Brazil's minister of culture, Gilberto Gil,
				who will be speaking on digital culture and related topics on
				Wednesday at the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference
				in Austin, Tex. Though today one of the country's most revered
				pop stars, Mr. Gil, 64, was often ostracized at the start of his
				own career and so feels a certain affinity with the hip-hop
				culture emerging here.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"These phenomena cannot be
				regarded negatively, because they encompass huge contingents of
				the population for whom they are the only connection to the
				larger world," he said in a February interview. "A government
				that can't perceive this won't have the capacity to formulate
				policies that are sufficiently inclusive to keep young people
				from being diverted to criminality or consigned to social
				isolation."</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As a result of the Culture Points
				and similar programs, Mr. Gil said, "you've now got young people
				who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and
				being used more and more by television and samba schools and
				revitalizing degraded neighborhoods." He added, "It's a
				different vision of the role of government, a new role."</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the ministry sees it, hip-hop
				culture consists of four elements: M.C.'s (rappers), D.J.'s,
				break dancers and graffiti artists. At the Projeto Casulo, a
				community center here on a narrow, winding street at the foot of
				a favela, or squatter slum, all four art forms are being taught
				to dozens of young residents.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"This program has really
				democratized culture," Guin Silva, a 32-year-old rapper who is
				the director of the center, said during a tour of its simple
				concrete building. "We've become a multimedia laboratory.
				Getting that seed money and that studio equipment has enabled us
				to become a kind of hip-hop factory."</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Though links to music run strong
				and deep in Brazilian culture, the notion of using taxpayers'
				money to encourage rap and graffiti art is not universally
				accepted. But because Mr. Gil's musical judgment is widely
				respected, the level of skepticism and resistance is lower than
				might be expected.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Gil still has to fight against
				other parts of the government in favor of things that everyone
				else there thinks are alienating junk, but he's willing to do
				that, whether it's on behalf of rap or funk or brega," another
				style of music considered vulgar and lower class, said Hermano
				Vianna, a writer and anthropologist who works in digital culture
				programs. "He looks at that sort of thing not with prejudice,
				but rather as a business opportunity."</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the other hand, some important
				exponents of hip-hop culture in Brazil, like the rapper Manu
				Brown and the writer Ferraz, remain skeptical and have chosen to
				keep their distance from the government program. Others are
				participating but complain of the bureaucracy involved.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"The idea is great because it has
				brought about a level of recognition we didn't have before,"
				said the rapper Aliado G., president of an entity called Hip Hop
				Nation Brazil. "But people get frustrated when a project of
				theirs is approved, and they can't get the money because they
				don't know how to do all the paperwork."</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Brazilian rap, at least as it has
				developed in poor neighborhoods here in the country's largest
				city, tends to be highly politicized and scornful of lyrics that
				boast about wealth or sexual conquests. In contrast, the funk
				movement in Brazil, also imported from the United States but
				centered in Rio de Janeiro, is unabashedly about celebrating
				sex, bling and violence.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"When U.S. rap groups come here
				and try to be ostentatious or do the gangster thing, they get
				booed off the stage," Mr. Silva said. "We feel a kinship with
				Chuck D and Public Enemy" known for their political commentary
				but we don't have any respect for people like
				<a title href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=298988&inline=nyt-per">

										<font face="Arial" size="2">Since
										established commercial radio stations
										and publishing houses have shown minimal
										interest in the music and poetry that
										new hip-hop artists are producing, or
										want to impose contract terms that are
										too stringent, rappers have developed
										their own channels to distribute their
										work. These range from selling their
										discs and books themselves on the
										streets and at shows to having the works
										played on a network of low-power but
										linked community radio stations.</font><p>
										<font face="Arial" size="2">"There is an
										entire industry being built in the
										informal sector," Mr. Vianna said. "If
										you were to apply all the laws in place
										today, no producer can release a record
										from a favela. So you have to create a
										new model, and Gil is willing to do
										that."</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the
										Projeto Casulo, the Culture Points
										program has produced a pair of
										documentaries about housing problems,
										complete with a rap accompaniment, that
										were broadcast on commercial television.
										The center has also generated a
										radionovela, a fanzine and a community
										newspaper and plans next to set up an
										online radio station to broadcast the
										rap songs that its musicians and those
										at similar community centers here have
										composed and recorded.</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In
										addition, a Culture Ministry grant
										enabled Hip Hop Nation Brazil to publish
										a book called "Hip Hop in Pencil," a
										collection of rap lyrics. After a first
										edition of 2,000 copies quickly sold out
										in 2005 and was nominated for a literary
										prize, a conventional publishing house
										was interested enough to negotiate a
										deal to publish subsequent editions.</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"We had
										never before seen our story told in a
										book, and at first the publishing houses
										didn't take us seriously," said Toni C,
										one of the editors and authors of the
										collection. "Books had always been used
										as a weapon against us, and people
										didn't know that such a thing as hip-hop
										literature existed. Now they do."</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Brazilian
										law also offers tax breaks to companies
										that contribute to cultural endeavors
										like films, ballet and art exhibitions.
										Rap music has now been granted similar
										standing, and as a result, some of the
										country's largest corporations have
										begun underwriting hip-hop records and
										shows.</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At a
										recent event in Campinas, a city of one
										million an hour's drive from here, the
										sponsors included a power company, a
										bank, a construction business and an
										industrial conglomerate. As a troupe of
										break dancers strutted their most flashy
										moves, D.J.'s and M.C.'s railed against
										social, economic and racial inequality
										with lyrics like "Reality is always
										hard/for those who have dark skin/if you
										don't watch out/you'll end up in the
										paddy wagon."</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"It took
										a while for companies to wake up to the
										potential this offers," said Augusto
										Rodrigues, an executive of the power
										company and the director of the cultural
										center where the show was held. "But
										there's a hunger for cultural programs
										like this, in which for the first time
										in 20 years, the ideology of the
										periphery can express itself."</font></div>

                an increasingly popular art form in Israel. Strolling along in

                stumble across a group of kids standing around on a streetcorner,
                beatboxing, freestyle rhyming, and even breakdancing, as they're
                surrounded by dozens of onlookers, smiling, dancing, and
                cheering them on. </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The current
                generation is the first to grow up regularly hearing hip-hop on
                the radio and watching it on television. As popular Jerusalem
                underground MC Sagol 59 has said, what took twenty years to
                happen with hip-hop in the U.S., has happened here in only a few
                short years. </span></p>

                folks generally tend to get hip-hop wrong. &quot;It's too violent,&quot;
                they say. Or, &quot;it promotes sexism and negative stereotypes.&quot;
                That has been the slant of articles in the mainstream media
                covering the trend here in Israel, and my events in particular.

                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">However
                well-intentioned such remarks tend to be, they generally ignore
                the fact that hip-hop is much more than just music; it's a
                reflection of the social circumstances from which it emanates.
                While not always level-headed in its expression, the goal of
                such music is ultimately to confront and challenge the listener,
                and to provide them with alternative viewpoints which lead them
                to question their own personal assumptions about issues such as
                race, class, and sexuality. </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">True, rap
                lyrics can contain sometimes shocking or disturbing language and
                imagery. Some hip-hop artists are known to offer rhymes which
                are certain to cause outrage when offered out of context. But
                such lyrics are not necessarily intended to advocate in favor of
                the content expressed, nor to incite the public, so much as
                incense them. Many hip-hop artists seek to raise awareness of
                the issues that inspire their lyrics, drawing them to the
                surface in the fevered intensity these artists often exhibit on
                stage, bringing attendant crowds to nod and bounce in
                concurrence. These lyrics are internalized by audiences who
                later reflect upon them in more depth, who perhaps learn and
                grow from what they have heard. </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Alienation
                is a theme most often touched upon, and one to which all youth
                can relate, and Israeli youth live in an especially complex and
                trying society that often leaves them confused and stressed.
                This has the potential to lead to depression, low self-esteem,
                criminal activity and drug abuse. These concerns affect Israelis
                across the spectrum of society, within the religious and secular
                communities, the Jewish and Arab communities, the Russian and
                Ethiopian communities, and so forth. </span></p>

                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The
                organization I have initiated, a hip-hop collective called
                Corner Prophets, which facilitates these monthly concerts, was
                created with the intention of bringing aspiring young hip-hop
                artists from throughout Israel's divergent communities together
                on a stage to share their art with one another and to hone their
                skills in the process. Further, it provides them with a
                positive, artistic outlet through which to express their
                thoughts and emotions. </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">

                the rising interest in hip-hop in Israel, we take advantage of
                hip-hop as a means to address the issues Israel's youth find
                themselves faced with by accepting them for who they are,
                encouraging their exploration of hip-hop, and welcoming them
                into a community. </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">So far we've
                enjoyed a great amount of success. We've brought together
                European Hareidim with Israeli Arabs, Modern Orthodox women with
                secular Russian men, African-American olim with lower-class kids
                from Ofakim, Tel Aviv punks with Jerusalem yeshiva students, and
                all sorts of folks from around the country. They come together
                to share a unique experience and explore this new art form which
                is attracting an ever-growing audience of teens and young adults
                from across religious, political and ethnic lines. </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sure,
                they're not always being enlightened or even necessarily civil
                with their lyrics. And due to the fact that we encourage artists
                to participate in their native tongues, sometimes the majority
                of the audience don't have a clue as to what an MC might be
                saying. But this is irrelevant, because ultimately, our goal is
                just to get these folks to hang out with one another and have a
                shared experience built around a common interest. Beyond a
                doubt, we have succeeded in accomplishing this goal, and this is
                what believe makes hip-hop a truly uniting force unlike most
                others. </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Thus
                regardless of the content - whether Palestinian MC Tamer Nafar
                gets up on stage and rages against the Zionist entity, the
                French Hasid Shmoopafly awkwardly boasts about Jewish unity,
                neo-Hasidic feminist hippie Oshra rhymes about the other artists

                &quot;nigga&quot; - we've got them all hanging out and talking with each
                other, having a good time with one another, and forming
                friendships and relationships. Together we've built a real

                hear. We didn't have to care. I'll tell you, it felt good. At
                that time, they were killing us. We were working so hard we

                Moments like those, when service members turn to rap to express,
                and perhaps relieve, fear, aggression, resentment and
                exhaustion, have become a common part of life during nearly two
                years of war in Iraq. &quot;Rap is the one place,&quot; Specialist

                Iraqi people who just didn't understand what we were doing. You

                Plenty of soldiers still listen to the twang of country music or
                the scream of heavy metal. Many, in fact, said that metal - and
                albums like Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; - helped psyche them up
                for combat as they roared across the desert in the very first
                days of conflict. But a great many say it was 50 Cent, Pastor
                Troy or Mystikal (himself, a Gulf war veteran) that kept them
                chugging along in trucks and Humvees - in one case, manning the

                The more than 1,450 American service members killed in Iraq have
                also left behind traces of hip-hop scattered in the memories.
                Sgt. Jack Bryant Jr., of Dale City, Va., who died last Nov. 20

                As for the many soldiers who are writing and performing their
                own raps, their lyrics sample the lexicon of the war - the
                Sandbox, I.E.D.'s (improvised explosive devices), I.C.D.C. (the
                Iraqi Civil Defense Corps) and Haji (the word many soldiers use
                derogatorily for the enemy) - and the wide scope of their
                feelings about it. &quot;There is a great potential for ambivalence

                Martin's Press). &quot;That's part of the ambivalence hip-hop has
                often carried. You hear two ideas in what they are saying here:
                An implicit critique of 'what am I doing here?' but at the same
                time, the idea of loyalty to your street soldiers, loyalty to

                First Armored Division's Second Battalion, Third Field Artillery

                as an extension of the cadence, or the calling-out songs to
                which troops run. And from the lyrics they write, it's clear
                that some of these soldiers identify their role - urban guerilla

                Some soldiers described jotting down lyrics on scraps of paper
                at night, between power failures. They rapped to whatever beat
                they could find - a homemade CD on a boom box or just some
                drumming on the metal armor of a Humvee. The soldiers joked that

                where service members held freestyle contests outside their
                sleeping quarters. Half a dozen soldiers or more would gather
                around; when the mortar rounds started coming - as they so often
                did between 7 p.m. and midnight - the music swiftly ended and
                everyone raced inside. As Specialist Terry Taylor, 27, recalls,
                those raps tended to come particularly fast. &quot;You wouldn't want

                not fully crossed over for all white soldiers, who tended
                instead to listen to country music. If true, it's a distinction
                affecting more than just what CD's get played in the barracks.
                For while country music has by and large been wildly supportive

                stories of crumbling neighborhoods, street violence , wild
                economic disparities and life-or-death swagger, helped them make
                sense of what they saw there.</span></b></p>

                &quot;When you start looking at the fighting between the Sunnis and

				ambles unenthusiastically to her sixth period English class. The

				But on this particular day, at Louis D. Brandeis High, their

				Public schools in urban areas are like what hip hop once was:
				under-resourced, ripe for social change, and full of organic
				creativity. It makes sense that schoolteachers would eventually
				find a way to bring hip hop into the classroom. Songs, videos,
				and artist profiles provide much-needed texts, adding flavor to
				dry social studies and civics classes. They offer the missing
				commentary on the lasting effects of racism and classism stories
				that are not typically found in mainstream history textbooks.</font><O:P></O:P></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">
				Analyzing rap lyrics offers the opportunity to create rhyming
				dictionaries, expand vocabulary, and encourage poetry and
				creative writing skills, giving voice to students who often feel
				powerless in schools that aren't meeting their needs.</font><O:P></O:P></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">
				Teachers use case studies of young hip hop entrepreneurs to
				teach successful business strategies. Some teachers have even
				begun using hip hop to educate younger children in mathematics,
				memorizing times tables to popular beats. While gym teachers are
				capitalizing on the "pop" of hip hop, to motivate kids to enjoy
				physical education classes.</font><O:P></O:P></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hip
				hop in the K-12 classroom mirrors hip hop's takeover of the
				academy, representing growing numbers of hip hop heads turned
				hip hop scholars. Over two hundred courses on the subject are
				currently offered at colleges and universities throughout the
				country. There are hip hop archives at both Harvard and
				Stanford. After becoming the first to bring hip hop to the
				academy in 1991, Howard is officially offering a hip hop studies
				minor this fall.</font><O:P></O:P></p>
				<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Such
				creative strategies are redefining the way we think about
				curriculum. The "classics" as we know them generally refer to
				books authored by and primarily about dead, white men. NYU
				Professor, David Kirkland, 30, says, 'I have argued that you can
				learn just as much about language and literature from reading

				Intermediate School 109 in Queens, N.Y., Brooklyn Community Arts
				and Media High School, and the Kuumba Academy in New Orleans, as
				well as a few others, have been dubbed "Hip Hop Schools." I.S.
				109's principal Shango Blake, 35, (the "Rappin' Principal") took
				over three years ago and has used hip hop to create a holistic
				learning experience where students make their own videos and
				short films. In the process, they end up learning production and
				graphic design, script writing, editing, marketing, and
				sequencing. Their student videos have been featured on HBO and
				premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. The results are
				dramatic-and have proven that teaching from a
				"culturally-relevant" perspective at I.S. 109, decreased
				drop-out rates, boasted a 12% increase in reading test scores,
				an 8% increase in math test scores and attendance is up to 93%
				overall, while simultaneously producing well-rounded, civic
				minded community members.</font><O:P></O:P></p>

				"Teachers have no other choice but to learn how to use hip hop
				in the classroom," says Talib Kweli, whose parents are both
				college professors. "It's the language of the children. They
				have to respect the culture of hip hop."</font><O:P></O:P></p>
				<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">But
				can all teachers use hip hop effectively? "Those seeking a
				long-term career teaching hip hop (for a living) need to be
				educated and then accredited themselves with legitimate
				certification from legitimate hip hop institutions," says KRS-One.
				"We can't just make stuff up!" Stic Man, of Dead Prez co-signs,
				"If we are gonna put hip hop in schools it shouldn't just be
				taught by teachers and scholars, it should be taught by people
				who actually do hip hop; real DJs, real graffiti artist, it will
				make it relevant."</font><O:P></O:P></p>

				Harlem rapper Juelz Santana, 23, adds his two cents, "How can

				<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some
				artists are up for the challenge, such as Patrick Douthit,
				better known as Little Brother producer 9th Wonder, who will be
				teaching a course on hip hop this fall at North Carolina Central
				University. 9th Wonder, 31, says he will teach as an
				artist-in-residence for the year. "I plan to spend the rest of
				my life teaching about the real history of hip hop - especially at
				Historically Black Colleges and Universities," he says. "I'm in
				the unique position of still being in the industry while
				teaching about the industry." His fall history course will begin
				with the "birth" of hip hop in 1973 spanning through March 9,
				1997, the day Biggie was killed.</font><O:P></O:P></p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">"I
				have encountered people that said hip hop has no socially
				redeeming value, that it's destructive to the minds of students,
				but I can always find a teachable moment. I laugh at the
				critics, I am a living example of an academic and artist,"
				laments Gabriel Benn, 31, special education teacher, also known
				as MC Asheru, creator of the Boondocks soundtrack. "While it
				runs the risk of becoming a fad, we must continue to add fuel to
				'the hip hop education movement' because it promises real and
				radical social and educational change," says Kirkland. Toni
				Blackman, U.S. State Department Hip Hop Ambassador, has traveled
				all over the globe educating teachers about how to maximize the
				use of hip hop in the classroom. "When people say it's not a
				movement, maybe they should say 'I don't know about this
				movement."</font><O:P></O:P></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some
				skeptics claim hip hop is too riddled with violence,
				commercialism, and misogyny to be useful in the classroom. Dr.
				Ishmail &quot;Dr C&quot; Conway, community educator in Washington D.C.
				warns, "Schools need artists not just performers, some hip hop
				is a lot of hype and not up to school standards." But, Daniel
				Zarazua, 31, an Oakland, Calif. based teacher confirms the
				value, "Through hip hop my students and I have tackled
				everything from immigration to homophobia and sexism."</font><O:P></O:P></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">
				Despite the positive results, for many educators, it's been an
				uphill battle to prove the merits of formally infusing hip hop
				into education. Blackman recalls, "It's only recently that hip
				hop in education has been embraced. I remember getting cancelled
				by the principal the day of an event, they didn't care that I
				had a Masters degree, they didn't give a damn that I traveled
				the world, all they knew is that this girl is "a rapper."</font><O:P></O:P></p>

					<span class="Apple-style-span">The inmates chose ''Oedipus

					<font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial" size="2">
					<span class="Apple-style-span">She took me backstage before

					mother, was an actress from New York City and the cast's
					only non-inmate. She told everyone how proud she was.
					Oedipus, with tongue-in-cheek pomposity, demanded silence
					and offered encouragement. ''Please, let's kill 'em,'' he

                It is fall. Fourth-graders in a Chicago school in a low-income
                neighborhood are focused and coiled with excitement. They are
                drawing portraits of each other in a lesson that is part of a
                unit on descriptive writing. They are deeply engaged, and the
                rich writing and art on the walls are evidence of real learning
                and accomplishment. Most other classrooms in the building also
                integrate the arts with other subjects and buzz with the

                The same day, in another low-income Chicago school,
                fourth-graders slump in their chairs, waiting to read a bit of
                advice to their classmates. They mumble, &quot;Don't hit your
                sister,&quot; and &quot;Do your homework.&quot; There is no children's work on
                the walls, no evidence of learning. Instead, posters remind
                students of rules they must follow. One asks, &quot;What is freedom?&quot;

                The new economy may require higher-order skills such as
                creativity, adaptability and teamwork, but most schools in
                low-income areas focus narrowly on &quot;basic&quot; academic skills,
                testing and discipline. The student boredom and academic failure
                that follow prompt calls for yet more testing and discipline.</span></p>

                The first school and others like it are proving that integrating
                the arts into the core of the academic program is a far more
                productive strategy. Recently the principal of Edgebrook,
                Chicago's highest-scoring non-selective elementary school,
                attributed her school's success to its embrace of the arts. &quot;We
                were concerned we might see a negative impact on test scores,&quot;
                Diane Maciejewski said. &quot;But actually, just the opposite
                happened.&quot;</span></p>

                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                &nbsp;A growing body of research is yielding data that support her
                claim. A study of 23 arts-integrated schools in Chicago showed
                test scores rising up to two times faster there than in
                demographically comparable schools. <b>A study of a Minneapolis
                program showed that arts integration has substantial effects for
                all students, but appears to have its greatest impact on
                disadvantaged learners</b>. Gains go well beyond the basics and
                test scores. Students become better thinkers, develop
                higher-order skills, and deepen their inclination to learn.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
                The studies also show that arts integration energizes and
                challenges teachers. Karen Seashore, a distinguished sociologist
                who studies urban schools, called the Minneapolis program &quot;one
                of the most powerful professional development experiences we
                have seen for large numbers of teachers.&quot;</span></p>

                When the arts are an interdisciplinary partner with other
                subjects, they generate conditions that cognitive scientists say
                are ideal for learning. The curriculum becomes more hands-on and
                project-based, offering what University of Chicago researchers
                have called authentic and challenging intellectual work.
                Learning in all subjects becomes visible through the arts.
                Teachers' opinions of their students rise.</span></p>

                Students invest emotionally in arts-integrated classrooms, where
                the curriculum often connects lessons to their own experience,
                and where they often work in groups and turn classrooms into
                learning communities. These classroom changes lead to a cascade
                of broader school changes. Schedules change to accommodate
                sustained attention to meaningful questions. Parents become more
                involved in schools. Teachers collaborate and take on new
                leadership roles.</span></p>

                &nbsp;These successes make clear that the arts are not just affective
                and expressive. They are also deeply cognitive. They develop the
                tools of thinking itself: careful observation of the world,
                mental representation of what is observed or imagined,
                abstraction from complexity, pattern recognition and
                development, symbolic and metaphoric representation, and
                qualitative judgment. We use these same thinking tools in
                science, philosophy, math and history. The advantage of the arts
                is that they link cognitive growth to social and emotional
                development. Students care more deeply about what they study,
                they see the links between subjects and their lives, their
                thinking capacities grow, they work more diligently, and they
                learn from each other.</span></p>

                &nbsp;Students will not be prepared for work in an economy that
                demands higher-order skills if their schools focus exclusively
                on the basics. Students will not learn to think for themselves
                if their schools expect them just to stay in line and keep
                quiet. Successful programs in Chicago, Minneapolis and elsewhere
                have proven that arts integration is within the reach of most
                schools and districts. Now research is showing that connecting
                the arts to learning across the curriculum is a strategy that
                helps close the achievement gap and make schools happier places
                by moving beyond a crippling focus on basics and discipline. It
                is time for more districts and schools to make use of this
                strategy.</span></p>

                The research, which is funded by the U.S. Department of
                Education, focused on four areas of juvenile education:
                curriculum, state assessments, accountability for assessment
                report results and special education. Following analysis of his
                initial research, Gagnon found&nbsp; that although budget problems
                are a large part of the juvenile education issue, it is still
                clear that juvenile education standards needs to be addressed.
                Gagnon also says that the release of this data might prompt
                legislators to create new requirements for juvenile education in
                correctional facilities across the country.</span></p>

                According to Gagnon, the problem with the current state of
                juvenile education in corrections is two-fold. First, a number
                of facilities do not administer required state assessment tests,
                leaving many juveniles to fall behind in work appropriate to
                their age-levels.&nbsp; Second, there is an obvious challenge in

                to a traditional education setting. Many juveniles become so
                frustrated while they are re-entering traditional high schools
                that they fail classes, become discouraged and then, re-offend.</span></p>
