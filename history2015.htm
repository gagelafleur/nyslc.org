          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">2015 - 2016 marked the tenth year of NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program. Following the successful <strong>Rebuilding Families</strong> pilot, NYSLC, again in partnership with the <strong>Rochester Broadway Theater League</strong> and the Office of The Sheriff, reunited incarcerated parents in NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program with their families through classroom readings and writing assignments while incarcerated and a shared experience attending a Broadway musical upon their release to reduce the impact of incarceration on children and to rebuild and reaffirm the family following incarceration.</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Rebuilding Families is a great idea. When I get out. I will be able to do something with my kids who I have not seen in a few months. I think my kids will be excited to be able to do something with me. Before I was incarcerated I took my kids to what I could afford. It is expensive, and this means a lot.</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I think it is good that Rebuilding Families is giving us the opportunity to help build the relationships with our families that we have lost.

I love my children more than life itself. Now I finally have a chance to give something to them to show them. It feels great to know there are still people who care in the world. Thank God.<br />

Not only am I able to engage in an activity with my son, but I can give him something that will open new worlds for him. My son loves music and singing, and I am so happy to know that this program is available to my family. Thank you for what you are giving us.<br />

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The Child Trends report, "Parents Behind Bars: What Happens to Their Children?," released on October 27, 2015 reveals that 1 in 9 black children have experienced parental incarceration, and children who are living in poverty are more than three times more likely to have a parent in prison than those from higher-income families. Children living in rural areas are also more likely than those in metropolitan areas to have had an incarcerated parent.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
