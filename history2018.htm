          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">NYSLC's experience in its twelve years of providing education programs for those incarcerated through its Incarcerated Education Program identified the children of those incarcerated as a priority, a need that was not addressed.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In its thirteenth year, NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program began to pull together the research, resources, books, studies, and videos on children whose parents were incarcerated with writing from the first-hand experience of those who had previously participated in <strong>The Community Engagement Seminar</strong> for a look at parental incarceration and the child outcomes associated with it. Children whose parents were incarcerated were the heart of the thirteenth year of NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program.</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Research on interventions for children with incarcerated parents is limited, but work so far suggests that reducing the trauma and stigma these children experience, improving communications between the child and the incarcerated parent, and making visits with the incarcerated parent more child-friendly may alleviate some of the negative effects of this separation.<br />

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">NYSLC went back to its 2010 program <strong>Murals for The Visiting Rooms</strong> <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/visitingroommural.htm" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.nyslc.org/visitingroommural.htm</a>. <strong>Dale Davis</strong> shared poems written by fourth grade students in Rochester whose parents were incarcerated with incarcerated youth in NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Programs at both Monroe County Jail and Monroe Correctional Facility. Statistics and research on children whose parents were incarcerated were also introduced. The incarcerated youth at both facilities became determined to reach out to young children affected by incarceration. After much discussion the idea of <strong>Murals for the Visiting Rooms</strong> at both Monroe County Jail and Monroe Correctional Facility to facilitate communication between children and their parents and siblings who are incarcerated took seed. The incarcerated youth put their thoughts and ideas into writing, sharing and discussing them. They then worked with visual artist <strong>Margot Muto</strong> to develop the murals.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">One <strong>Mural for the Visiting Room</strong> has been in the Visiting Room of Monroe County Jail since 2010. The second <strong>Mural for the Visiting Room</strong> was located in the Visiting Room at Monroe Correctional Facility from 2010 - 2019. In 2019 this mural was moved to a room in Monroe County Jail. Children's books, donated to NYSLC, were made available for deputies to give to children visiting a parent at Monroe Correctional Facility. In 2019, the donated children's books were moved to Monroe County Jail.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">NYSLC has always valued the personal experiences of those participating in its programs to inform program development. There is a universal theme that runs through the writing of those in the Incarcerated Education Program. Participants are well informed about who they are and about the conditions that led them to their incarceration. Fractured families, drugs, abandonment, poor education, the streets, illegal activities, poor communication skills, many socio-economic needs, poor connection with their families and their community are mileposts. Upon release they have to cope with the difficulty of finding employment and stable housing while reestablishing a relationship with their children. This year NYSLC looked to the personal experience of <strong>Community Engagement Seminar</strong> participants for collaboration to help steer and develop an annotated guide of resources, ongoing research, books, studies, and videos for <strong>Rebuilding Families</strong>, to help children, children who have committed no crime, and families deal with incarceration.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In <strong>Rebuilding Families</strong> NYSLC's commitment to literacy, education, and community engagement included the development of communication and expressive skills between parents and children by working with those in <strong>The Community Engagement Seminar</strong> to collaborate and help steer and develop the annotated guide of resources that could be used as a reference to facilitate bringing families together, benefit children's education, and as an educational resource.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This year, however, was difficult as in mid-January 2019 NYSLC was informed there would be a gradual downsizing at Monroe Correctional Facility, moving those incarcerated there to Monroe County Jail. From mid-January until the end of May, the classroom for NYSLC's <strong>Community Engagement Seminar</strong> was moved three times to different classrooms, to different days of the week, and to different times. NYSLC's library, including children's books, <strong>Picturing Our Dreams</strong>, the mural created by inmates in 2011, self-portraits created by inmates in 2008 <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/visualart2yr.htm" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.nyslc.org/visualart2yr.htm</a> were not transferred each time. Computers with internet access were not present in all of the classrooms. Consistency of the day of the week, the time, and the location are important for the stability of a program in a correctional facility. Internet access enabled participants to be active, engaged learners working together on a project. The gradual downsizing and the moving of rooms, of days, and of times, meant attendance was not consistent. May 24 was NYSLC's last day at Monroe Correctional Facility as all incarcerated housed there were transferred to Monroe County Jail. NYSLC's expectation when the Incarcerated Education Program began in the fall of 2018 had been the Seminar would run through the end of June. Due to the variables and May 24 being the last day, NYSLC created a space on <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.nyslc.org/</a> to house <strong>Incarceration: Its Impact of Incarceration on Children and Families</strong> the annotated guide of resources, research, books, studies, and videos on how incarceration impacts children and families to reach out to incarcerated parents, children, educators, schools, and cultural organizations on the burdens faced by children. One of the participants in the Seminar wrote a poem on the work Seminar participants did this year for <strong>Rebuilding Families</strong>.</font></span></p>
