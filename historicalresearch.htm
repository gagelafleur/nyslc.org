				<span id="Label4"><font face="Arial">At no point did European
				society entertain serious sanctions against abandonment; most
				ethical systems either tolerated or regulated desertion. The
				English Poor Laws, beginning with the Statute of Laborers in
				1349, began regulating the working and nonworking poor, and in
				1536 provided an act that states �Children less than fourteen
				years of age and above five that live in idleness, and be taken
				begging may be put to service - to husbandry, or other crafts or
				labours.�<br>
				<br>
				In 1601, primary family responsibility was added to the English
				Poor Laws and local authorities were empowered to build housing
				for the impotent and poor. If it was found that a child�s
				parents were unable to care for the, the child could be taken
				away and made an apprentice.<br>
				<br>
				Eventually abandoned and neglected children became the
				responsibility of the monarch, and the Commonwealth became their
				guardian. The �Parens Patriae,� doctrine meaning �father of the
				country,� gave courts the right to act in place of the parent
				and recognized the monarch as the overall father figure (the
				godfather) of all the populace. This established societal
				patterns that left children with few personal rights. <br>
				<br>
				The ideas of the European courts and customs, especially the
				English Poor Laws, set the practices for subsequent social
				legislation and regulation of the working poor in Colonial
				America. (They may even be compared with the health, safety, and
				welfare system in America today.)<br>
				<br>
				In England, society�s attitude toward delinquent children began
				to change in 1788. The Philanthropic Society of London, under
				the influence of John Howard(1), established an �asylum,� a
				place of safety for delinquent boys. Another group, the Society
				for the Reformation of Juvenile Offenders, established a
				similar, separate refuge in 1816, and a public institution for
				juvenile delinquents was opened near Birmingham in 1817.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Early American Reform</strong><br>
				<br>
				In America similar concerns about housing delinquent and
				abandoned children led to the separation of juveniles and
				adults. In 1817, the Society for the Prevention of Pauperism was
				formed in New York City. In its 1822 paper, �The Penitentiary
				System in the United States,� the society argued that there was
				a necessity to provide new and separate prisons for juveniles.
				However, the prisons were to be operated as schools for
				instruction rather than punishment. Vocational training and
				reformation was stressed.<br>
				<br>
				The first American publicly funded and legally chartered
				custodial institution for juvenile offenders, the �House of
				Refuge,� was established in New York City in 1824. In
				Philadelphia similar institutions followed in 1860. The first
				houses were multi-story, grim, prison-like institutions. <br>
				<br>
				During the mid-1800s the almshouse and workhouse practices
				evolved into the training school, reformatory, truant school or
				school of industry. The concept of the congregate living and
				working situation was used as a means of training the abandoned
				or delinquent juvenile.<br>
				<br>
				The reform school system was introduced in Westborough,
				Massachusetts, at the Lyman Reform School for Boys, in 1846, and
				at the Reform School for Boys in Lancaster, Ohio, in 1858. The
				treatment philosophy of these institutions recognized that
				juveniles were more likely to be rehabilitated than adults and,
				therefore, should not be treated within adult institutions.<br>
				<br>

				Westborough, Massachusetts<br>
				<br>
				The Lyman School was almost self-sufficient. Youth raised
				livestock, grew vegetables, sewed their own clothes and built
				many of the facilities located on the school grounds. These
				facilities were the models for the Colorado�s Mount View Campus
				in 1881 and Washington�s Greenhill School in 1886.<br>

				<br>
				<strong>Reform Movements</strong><br>
				<br>
				Despite the increased use of reformatories or training schools,
				the notion of punishment rather than reform was difficult to
				abolish. In the decade of the 1880s(2), the nation experienced a
				50 percent increase in the number of prison inmates. Child
				offenders constituted one-fifth of the prison population, both
				adult and juvenile. Confinement conditions prevalent at the
				time, disease, squalor, and overcrowded living areas, led to
				public concern and initiated a series of reform movements.<br>
				<br>
				Advocates during the 1890s, referred to as the �child savers,�
				emphasized the need for prevention and opposed the conditions of
				the reform schools. They founded children�s aid societies to
				distribute food and clothing, and to provide temporary shelter
				and employment for destitute youths. Urban youngsters were
				placed in apprenticeships with farm families in the West and
				Midwest.<br>
				<br>
				A similar movement in Chicago was organized by a group of
				feminist reformers who passed special laws for juveniles and
				created institutions for their care and protection. Louise de
				Koven Bowen and Jane Addams were civic-minded philanthropists
				who transformed child saving from a respectable hobby into a
				passionate commitment.<br>
				<br>
				Bowen�s primary interest was the protection and welfare of
				children. She attributed the rise of youthful crime to the
				corrupting influences of city life, where dirt, crowding,
				artificiality, and impersonality robbed children of their
				innocence. Playgrounds, supervised recreation, �morals police,�
				kindergartens, visits to the country, stricter laws, and more
				efficient law enforcement were her solutions to delinquency. The
				problem of juvenile crime, said Bowen, would be diminished by
				stringent enforcement of laws and the development of resolute
				character in youth.<br>
				<br>
				Addams was the epitome of professional philanthropy. Her
				full-time career was centered on youth and family reform
				interests. After college graduation, she encountered the concept
				of a settlement house at Toynbee Hall in London and observed
				educated university graduates living and providing social
				services in the neighborhood community.<br>
				<br>
				<img src="http://www.corrections.com/ezine/ezine_images/0314hull.jpg"><br>
				Hull House Butler Building<br>
				Chicago, Illinois<br>
				<br>
				In 1889 with Ellen Gates Starr, Addams established Hull House.
				The settlement house was located at the corner of Polk and
				Halsted streets in Chicago. The neighborhood was a slum with
				overcrowded tenements, crime, inadequate schools, inferior
				hospitals and insufficient sanitation. Hull House workers
				organized clubs, recreation, and educational programs for people
				in the neighborhood. The distinguishing characteristic of the
				settlement house was its ability to deliver services without
				employing professional social workers or welfare agency staff.
				Social and welfare workers of the time had developed a
				reputation for being judgmental and punitive.<br>
				<br>
				Contemporary delinquency control and prevention programs can be
				traced to the reforms of the child savers at the end of the
				nineteenth century. Socially responsible citizens created
				special judicial and correctional institutions for the
				identification and management of troubled youth. The origins of
				the definition of the juvenile as a delinquent are found in the
				programs and ideas promulgated by these social reformers. This
				era of public responsibility was the next step in the evolution
				of social reform and welfare programs in America(3).<br>

				<strong>Juvenile Courts</strong><br>
				<br>
				In 1899, the Chicago Bar Association supported a statue which
				established a separate and distinct legal process for mistreated
				or delinquent juveniles. The concept followed the Parens Patriae
				principles and appointed the juvenile court as the
				representative of the state acting in lieu of the parent and in
				the best interest of the child.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Cottage Institutions</strong><br>
				An important improvement in institutions constructed to house
				and treat juvenile delinquents began when the prison-like
				barracks were gradually replaced by smaller cottages and
				operated according to the principles of the �family plan� by
				house parents. Living units were administered by married
				resident supervisors who lived with the children.<br>
				<br>
				The origins of the family plan can be traced back to the Rauhe
				Haus, founded in 1833 by Dr. Johann Heinrich Wichern near
				Hamburg. The separate residential cottage plan was also
				introduced by the French penal reformer, Frederic Auguste Demetz.
				The French youth campus was opened in 1840 at Mettray. The
				cottages were three-story structures, with ground floor
				workshops. Like the early Pennsylvania prisoner reformers,
				Demetz believed in the influence of hard work. He also was
				enlightened enough to set up a form of self-government for the
				detainees.<br>
				<br>
				The concept or model of self government was instituted in the
				early 1900s at the George Junior Republic in Freeville, which is
				near Ithaca, New York. The institution organized the treatment
				to be a virtual microcosm of the outside world, and
				self-government meant that youths were involved in the
				definition and enforcement of rules under the close supervision
				of staff. This concept is still fundamental in treatment methods
				known as guided group interaction or positive peer culture.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>House Parents</strong><br>
				<br>
				Cottage parents were to provide the paternal supervision,
				understanding, and counsel that were missing in the youth�s home
				life. The system exists today at Girls and Boys Town in
				Nebraska, Le Roy Boys Home in California, The David and Margaret
				Home in California, and other small, private programs.<br>
				<br>
				Early programs were positive. A surrogate family was better than
				no family. Today labor laws require a hybrid structure. Statutes
				limit the weekly work period to 40 or 48 hours per employee.
				Therefore house parents cannot be �at home� except for normal
				working hours. Their presence has to be supplemented by day
				counselors and other support staff. Homelike stability,
				therefore, is confused, relegated to rules and procedures from
				others - the definition of an institution (4).<br>
				<br>
				Between 1910 and 1940, changes to the architecture of juvenile
				facilities were minimal. Cottages located on large rural
				campuses usually operated by the state were modeled after prison
				site plans. <br>
				<br>
				Several juvenile institutions were also located in older
				correctional facilities or state hospital sites. Examples
				include the Minnesota Home School in Sauk Centre, Minnesota;
				Greenhill School in Chehalis, Washington; Mount View School in
				Golden, Colorado; and Lorenzo Benn School in Atlanta, Georgia.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Federal Practices</strong><br>
				<br>
				Prior to 1938, no special provisions existed for the treatment
				of juvenile offenders who came to the attention of the Federal
				Courts. The enactment of the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act of
				1938 provided flexible procedures for the handling of boys and
				girls under the age of 18, and permitted Federal Courts to adopt
				the procedures used by state juvenile courts.<br>
				<br>
				The law enabled United States attorneys to prosecute youthful
				offenders for delinquency, rather than charge them with a
				specific crime. A wider range of alternatives to incarceration
				(programs) and treatment options were therefore possible.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Professional Treatment</strong><br>
				<br>
				Following World War I, basic changes occurred in the care of
				dependent children and juvenile law offenders. These programs
				included a better means of identifying dependence and delinquent
				behavior; the professional training of social workers; the
				development of the social casework method; and the organization,
				both public and private, of social service agencies. Emphasis
				shifted from the authoritative and even punitive attitude of
				earlier reform efforts. Each child became an individual case,
				and the placement of juveniles in boarding homes and foster care
				became more widespread.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Social Services</strong><br>
				<br>
				During the Depression and World War II, the functions of
				government increased greatly. Local agencies provided social
				services to the public: welfare, health, employment, mental
				health, education, and services related to the needs of
				children. Passage of the Social Security Act of 1935 also
				encouraged the development of local child welfare services. The
				juvenile justice system philosophy expanded to include
				delinquency prevention and rehabilitation. Changes in the
				juvenile justice system altered court procedures and
				dispositions, and initiated the use of juvenile court referees
				and juvenile court probation personnel.<br>

				week�s Corrections Connection ezine and discuss how a new
				generation of thinking influenced juvenile facilities across the

				End Notes:<br>
				(1) John Howard (1726-1790) was the leading advocate of
				eighteenth century prison reform in England. In the 1770s,
				Howard inspected prisons throughout England and Europe. His most
				important publication, �Study of Prisons� (1777), surveyed
				European prison conditions, proposed reforms, and coined the
				word �penitentiary.� He promoted numerous prison reforms
				including improving sanitation, classifying inmates, hiring
				qualified staff, eliminating corruption in prison management,
				and discontinuing the practice of collecting fees from inmates.
				In the United States, an organization bearing his name was
				created in 1900 to help newly freed prisoners make the
				transition to the community. The John Howard Association
				continues to be a respected advocate of prison reform (Roberts,
				19).<br>
				<br>
				The modern definition of a penitentiary is a maximum-security
				penal institution: a prison with the highest walls, the
				strongest locks, the tightest restriction, and the toughest
				inmates. Originally, however, the word �penitentiary� derived
				from �penance.� A penitentiary was a place where offenders were
				sent to do penance for their crimes and attain redemption,
				through isolation, reflection, and hard work. (Roberts, p. 31)<br>
				<br>
				In both England and the United States, adherents of the Quaker
				religion were among the most dedicated and influential prison
				reformers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They
				believed that reformation and salvation should be the objective
				of punishment. They worked tirelessly for more humane prisons
				and rejected corporal and capital punishment. <br>
				<br>
				The American penitentiary emerged largely due to the efforts of
				the Quakers, specifically William Penn who established Quakerism
				in North America. He was Governor of Colonial Pennsylvania when
				it made early attempts to establish incarceration as a humane
				and constructive alternative to other forms of punishment. In
				1787, Quakers were among the founders of the Philadelphia
				Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prison, which was
				instrumental in bringing about the realization of the
				penitentiary concept at the Walnut Street Jail and Eastern State
				Penitentiary.<br>
				<br>
				New York businessman and philanthropist Thomas Eddy, warden of
				New York City�s New Gate Prison, was a Quaker. His impact on
				prisons was so great that he has been called America�s John
				Howard. He and other New York Quakers formed the Society for the
				Prevention of Pauperism in the early 1800s which endeavored to
				improve treatment of juvenile offenders and promote the
				development of single prisons (Roberts, 30). <br>
				<br>
				Ironically, by the late twentieth century, many Quakers
				regretted Quakerism�s historic involvement with prisons and
				contributions to the development of penitentiaries. A leading
				group of Quaker activists, the American Friends Service
				Committee, lamented in 1971 that �the horror that is the
				American prison system grew out of an eighteenth-century reform
				by Pennsylvania Quakers and others against the cruelty and
				futility of capital and corporal punishment.� The committee
				concluded that �this two-hundred-year-old experiment has
				failed.� (Roberts, p. 30) <br>
				<br>
				(2) Between 1850 and 1900, America was evolving as a nation and
				relied primarily on European education methods, traditions, and
				historical precedent. The clergy, medicine, engineering, and law
				were recognized as professions. <br>
				<br>
				After the Civil War, American cities underwent dramatic,
				unprecedented change. With the growth of the poor urban
				population, crime increased and agencies and jurisdictions had
				to deal with criminal behavior, jail/prison overcrowding and
				miserable conditions of confinement. <br>
				<br>
				At the same time, immigration, the development of efficient
				transportation systems, and urban growth presented the
				opportunity to increase the awareness of social problems. Social
				responsibility is a concern for the common good, a respect for
				human dignity, a commitment to the cause of social justice, and
				responsiveness to the effects of one�s interventions in the
				natural environment (Wasserman, 2000, 123-24). <br>
				<br>
				Society was becoming aware of the collective responsibility for
				the poor and less fortunate which included children. Numerous
				groups begin to focus on the reform movements of the time. A
				responsibility for wayward youth was one of outcomes of this
				societal concern. <br>
				<br>
				(3) The child-saving movement provided middle-class women with a
				vehicle for promoting acceptable �public� roles and for
				restoring some of the authority and spiritual influence that
				women had seemingly lost through the urbanization of family
				life. (Richard Hofstadter makes the same point about the clergy
				at the end of the nineteenth century in The Age of Reform,
				151-152.) Child saving may be understood as a crusade which
				served symbolic and ceremonial functions for middle-class
				Americans. <br>
				<br>
				The movement was not so much a break with the past as an
				affirmation of faith in traditional institutions. Parental
				authority, home education, rural life, and the independence of
				the family as a social unit were emphasized because they seemed
				threatened at this time by urbanism and industrialization. The
				child savers elevated the nuclear family, especially women as
				stalwarts of the family, and defended the family�s right to
				supervise the socialization of youth (Platt, 98).<br>
				<br>
				The child savers should not be considered libertarians or
				humanists. Their reforms did not herald a new system of justice
				but rather expedited traditional policies which had been
				informally developing during the nineteenth century. They
				implicitly assumed the �natural� dependence of adolescents and
				created a special court to impose sanctions on premature
				independence and behavior unbecoming to youth.<br>
				<br>
				Their attitudes toward delinquent youth were largely
				paternalistic and romantic, but their commands were backed by
				force. They trusted in the benevolence of government and
				similarly assumed a harmony of interest between delinquents and
				agencies of social control. They also promoted correctional
				programs requiring longer terms of imprisonment, long hours of
				labor and militaristic discipline, and the inculcation of
				middle-class values and lower-class skill (Platt, p. 176).<br>
				<br>
				(4) Erving Geoffman�s definition of the institution(1961): The
				central feature of total institutions can be described as a
				breakdown of the barriers ordinarily separating these three
				spheres of life (work, home, and friends). First, all aspects of
				life are conducted in the same place and under the same single
				authority. Second, each phase of the member�s daily activity is
				carried on in the immediate company of a large batch of others,
				all of whom are treated alike and required to do the same thing
				together. Third, all phases of the day�s activities are tightly
				scheduled, with one activity leading at a prearranged time into
				the next, the whole sequence of activities being imposed from
				above by a system of explicitly formal rulings and a body of
				officials. Finally, the various enforced activities are brought
				together into a single rational plan purportedly designed to
				fulfill the official aims of the institution.<br>
