				Dale Davis' distinguished career as a writer, educator, publisher, scholar, producer, dramaturge, and advocate for young people began as one of the founding poets of New York State Poets In The Schools. As a publisher she established The Sigma Foundation, a limited edition, private press with Dr. James Sibley Watson, Jr., avant-garde filmmaker and publisher and editor of The Dial magazine, the leading modernist journal of arts and letters. The Sigma Foundation published the work of Margaret Anderson, Mina Loy, and Djuna Barnes. The Sigma Foundation's books are in many permanent collections, including The Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Library, Yale University and The Collection of American Women at Smith College.</span></p>

				In 1979, she founded The New York State Literary Center (NYSLC) <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/" style="color:black;">https://www.nyslc.org/</a> where she continues to serve as Executive Director. Writers, editors, and artists who have worked with Dale Davis as integral contributors to NYSLC's programs included Homero Aridjis, William Bronk, Kenneth Burke, Robert Creeley, Malcolm Cowley, Robert Fitzgerald, Kamilah Forbes, Jonathan Galassi, Hugh Kenner, Ted Kooser, James Laughlin, Ruth Maleczech, Emir Rodriguez Monegal, Octavio Paz, William Stafford, Carrie Mae Weems, and Eliot Weinberger. Davis' belief in all young people expanded NYSLC's programs to reach students at the highest risk for educational failure. Today NYSLC serves incarcerated adults through interdisciplinary, strength based arts programs.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial; color: black">
				NYSLC has published over 600 books of writing by young people, 30 children's books by incarcerated youth, and has produced thirty CDs. Davis has written 15 hip hop theater pieces adapted from the writing of those in NYSLC's programs that have been performed in high schools across New York State, nationally in juvenile justice facilities and in correctional facilities. A NYSLC program was featured at the William Carlos Williams Centennial at the Harvard Club in New York for the Modern Language Association Convention. NYSLC's programs have been the subject of articles in <em>New York Magazine</em> and <em>The New York Times</em> and honored and nationally recognized by The President's Committee on Arts and Humanities, The Center for Disease Control National AIDS Clearinghouse, the American Council on The Arts, The National Alternative Education Association, The National Dropout Prevention Association, the Annenberg School of Communication, Arts In Criminal Justice, and a documentary by Columbia University's EdLab. Davis' work with young people in the juvenile justice system in St. Louis was the subject of a Fox News Documentary. She was invited to participate in Harvard University's Institute on The Arts and Civic Dialogue, established by playwright and actor Anna Deavere Smith. In 2014, she received the Andrew P. Meloni Award from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office for dedication and commitment to improve the education of those incarcerated through NYSLC's arts, education, and rehabilitation programs.

				NYSLC collaborated with an on line service for journalists to inform the public about children's' issues. The service's website cited NYSLC as an example of the type of project for youth at-risk that was promoted by The President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Students writing was featured on the website, both as a hook for journalists and as an example of how to write a story. Her installations, combining the writing of young people and her own photographs, have been exhibited in several prominent venues. Davis' work was featured in a cover story in <em>Leadership</em>, published by the Points of Light Foundation, and was the subject of "Fighting The Streets with Art and Literature" in <em>Education New York</em>.
