                Of The Post-Dispatch<br>
                </font>April 21, 2004</p>
                <p>The hip-hop look doesn't do it for Dale Davis, who is in her 
                late 50s, but she is a fan of rap. Earlier this month, Davis 
                conducted a weeklong hip-hop poetry workshop at the St. Louis 
                Juvenile Detention Center. Meeting for the first time with 
                students at the center's Griscom School, Davis said, &quot;There is a 
                stereotype you have to get over. I'm old, and I'm white. Now . . 
                . we're moving on.&quot; </p>
                <p>That they did. At week's end, Davis had 20 pages of hip-hop 
                poetry penned by the 40 teens. She also had a rough cut of the 
                young poets reading their work, and soon each participant will 
                have the finished CD. </p>
                <p>&quot;Mainstream society neglects rhyme books full of hip-hop 
                poetry, but enabling students to speak for themselves in their 
                own language is increasingly important today, because too many 
                of our students are alienated,&quot; Davis said in an interview 
                before class. </p>
                <p>A writer and educator based in Rochester, N.Y., Davis is vice 
                president of the Association of Teaching Artists. She is 
                convinced that using rap in the classroom raises literacy 
                levels, encourages self-expression and motivates students, maybe 
                even keeps them in school. </p>
                <p>Calling rap &quot;among the most important influences in American 
                youth culture today,&quot; Davis uses the rhyming poetry to motivate 
                troubled adole scents to think, write and learn. &quot;I'm telling 
                the students that, if an epic poem is a guide to civilization, 
                the CD we are writing here will be a guide to St. Louis.&quot; </p>
                <p>Midweek, eight young men barely old enough to drive -- all 
                dressed in identical red sweats and and all awaiting hearings on 
                crimes they have allegedly committed - filed into the library of 
                the center, which is at 3847 Enright Avenue. Davis greeted them, 
                handed out the lyrics to &quot;Moment of Clarity&quot; by rapper Jay-Z and 
                then played the recording of the same name. </p>
                <p>&quot;This is the time for your moment of clarity,&quot; Davis said 
                afterward. &quot;When you're in the Juvenile Detention Facility, you 
                have time to think, time to reflect. What do you see clearly? 
                Later, we're going to write about that.&quot; </p>
                <p>Davis told the students that DMX taught himself to write 
                while in detention facilities in New York and that Black Ice 
                learned to write at Rykers Island Prison, also in New York. She 
                talked about the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation's arts camp in 
                Georgia. </p>
                <p>Then Davis brought out an anthology of poetry by one of her 
                former students, one of some 500 books Davis has published 
                through the New York State Literary Center. Davis said she sells 
                the books and gives the profits to the authors. She read aloud 
                &quot;The Message&quot; and &quot;Ghetto Girl&quot; by Starmeisha Jones. The first 
                poem begins: &quot;I don't feel a part of anything. I am unattached. 
                I have no sense of belonging or security.&quot; </p>
                <p>Nodding in appreciation - or maybe recognition - one young 
                man said, &quot;That's nice.&quot; </p>
                <p>Addressing a student in the front row, Davis said, &quot;You've 
                got a book in you, maybe many books. You know that, right?&quot; 
                Slouched in his chair and fiddling with a pencil, he allowed 
                himself a small grin of pleasure. Another teen commented that 
                poetry books by peers inspire other students. Everyone nodded.
                </p>
                <p>Then, calling for silence in the room, Davis said, &quot;You must 
                respect people when they read, because it's your heart and soul 
                on the page.&quot; </p>
                <p>One by one, pride triumphing over shyness, the young men 
                moved to the front of the room to read work completed earlier in 
                the week. The students applauded after each reading. </p>
                <p>One poem, written by a student who said this was his first 
                writing class, began like this: &quot;Small time gangsta doing wrong 
                living out on the streets. Do you see a child, or do you see a 
                man to be?&quot; </p>
                <p>Another wrote: &quot;Life taught me to sell drugs, smoke, and show 
                love, and run from the law, and if I get caught not to tell what 
                I saw.&quot; </p>
                <p>One teen penned a prayer in rhyme. Another's poem asked, 
                &quot;Would I have been so messed up if a teacher hadn't told me to 
                shut up, had listened to me, had helped me to read instead of 
                seeing only hate?&quot; </p>
                <p>This work is not new to Davis. As a founder of the New York 
                State Poets in the Schools program, Davis was asked in the late 
                1980s to write a play using writing by high school students. 
                &quot;First I read their work. Then I started listening to their 
                music,&quot; said Davis. &quot;I loved Public Enemy, and I started buying 
                rap CDs and playing them in my car.&quot; That led to her develop the 
                hip-hop poetry workshops 11 years ago. </p>
                <p>Back in the classroom, Davis occasionally asked for a second 
                reading, as this was a rehearsal for taping sessions scheduled 
                later in the week. Sometimes, she encouraged &quot;bigger voices&quot; 
                from the young men, who tended to speak softly. Some of them 
                understood and complied, as some have taken part in &quot;I'm an 
                Actor,&quot; an arts education program offered at the center through 
                Prison Performing Arts, a local organization that works with 
                incarcerated adults and children throughout Missouri. </p>
                <p>Visitor Agnes Wilcox, artistic director of Prison Performing 
                Arts, said, &quot;This hip-hop workshop has it all - literacy 
                training, presentation skills, poetry exploration. It helps 
                students gain a sense of accomplishment and self-respect.&quot; </p>
                <p>Wilcox joined forces with Debbie Corson, arts education 
                director at Young Audiences of St. Louis, to bring Davis to St. 
                Louis. Their efforts were met with much enthusiasm. Allen 
                Irving, superintendent of the Juvenile Detention Center, noted 
                that Davis' program &quot;builds listening skills at the same time it 
                taps into the students' talents.&quot; </p>
                <p>Next, Davis asked the teens to think back to Jay-Z's &quot;Moment 
                of Clarity&quot; and to consider what they see clearly. She handed 
                out paper, and, for 20 minutes, most of the teens wrote 
                steadily. </p>
                <p>One young man put down his pencil and said he couldn't do the 
                assignment. In a simple exchange that is a measure of the 
                workshop's success, a fellow student looked over at him and 
                said, &quot;Try.&quot; </p>
