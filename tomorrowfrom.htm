I believe we need to learn how to succeed. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Based solely on my experiences in Monroe County Jail, I suggest a simple proposal. There are those of us who are trying to change ourselves. We ask you to recognize this need and offer us programs, like The New York State Literary Center&rsquo;s Program on Three North, like the Jimmy Santiago Baca Library, Writing, and Publishing Center, and like the performance this evening that can help us succeed and let us show you we are worth a second chance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Young people in Rochester are branded with a criminal conviction at sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen years of age.

He was admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage. The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion, I know nothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me. My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant--before I knew her as my mother. It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age. Frequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field labor. For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to hinder the development of the child&#39;s affection toward its mother, and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child. This is the inevitable result.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration, and at night. She died when I was about seven years old, on one of my master&#39;s farms, near Lee&#39;s Mill. I was not allowed to be present during her illness, at her death, or burial. She was gone long before I knew anything about it. Never having enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her soothing presence, her tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c10">Frederick Douglass</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c4">What is wrong with us?

What is wrong with us? Don&rsquo;t we know the only way to get out of this game is prison or death? And if so, why do we keep playing Russian roulette with our freedom? You see I&rsquo;m no new mind to the streets. Basically, I&rsquo;ve been there and done that. I&rsquo;ve been in and out of the system for felonies since I was thirteen. I&rsquo;ve almost lost every man I have ever respected to the system. I&rsquo;ve almost been killed three times in the past year.

What really provoked the incident is not the main issue, it is the lack of values we have taught out children of the precious gift of life. Taking one&rsquo;s life in one way or another is wrong and the blame is placed on all of us Blacks, because that is the way society sees us. If one of does something that is out of line, all of us are put in the same category, which we cannot afford this kind of reputation. We all know the race is blamed for incidents such as this and it is an individual not a group of people, but because of the racist element in our country we are blamed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">Mildred Johnson</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Could I be dead?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Should I be dead?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Will I die this day</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">or the next?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I don&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It is a dreadful time for a young man,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">watching my back,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">hiding out,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">even trying to get him before the gets me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s just the life I live.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Thinking and thinking, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">this is all I do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">When, when, when will my time come?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I feel it&rsquo;s near.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I feel the heat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;m ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">No, I&rsquo;m not.
