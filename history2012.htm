                  I have learned that to know where I belong<br />
                  I have to know who I am.<br />

                  This is hard<br />
                  because I have taken so many roles in my life,<br />
                  I don't know which one is really me<br />

I learned how to express what I had on the inside through acting. I learned to use my voice, and I smiled. I really never smile at all. Working with David Shakes is cool. He is a nice person who takes the time to really work with us. He is a great professional at what he does. He makes acting come to life.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
