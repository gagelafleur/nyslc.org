                        <p class="indent">The Wall began as an idea, a space to share writing and visual art in a school corridor. The students writing was on their childhoods, music, divorce, advice received from adults, the school curriculum. I
                          wanted the writing to be on panels in the corridor, an installation that would be read differently from words on a page or art work in the art room. Owing to its location, the wall would have to be physically encountered in
                          the school corridor. I wanted the force and intensity of the students' writing to be experienced in large, bold letters and to be placed within the context of contemporary culture. The wall enabled me to present the
                          students' views visually in a format which was a natural and yet not a natural part of the everyday school environment. &nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="indent">The book is the wall in another form. I used the visual installation to create another experience.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="indent">The <em>AIDS 'N US PROJECT</em> began with a student who asked me to do a residency on AIDS education. The student wanted to be informed about AIDS, and she wanted to become actively involved in AIDS
                          education in her community. The <em>AIDS 'N US PROJECT</em> is based upon students as peer educators. The book is an outcome of the students' attempts to comprehend the AIDS epidemic and to reach out to their peers and the
                          larger community.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="indent">I was the catalyst. I placed facts, information, and statistics along with writing by students on AIDS as a presence in their lives on an installation on two panels in a main corridor in the school. It was
                          my intention that the installation should invite and challenge all students walking in the corridor to stop, to look to read, to think, to get serious about protecting themselves from HIV infection. The installation enabled
                          the students in the <em>AIDS 'N US PROJECT</em> to present the information in an all they were learning format that could be place in their everyday school environment.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="indent">The book is another metamorphosis of the project, an invitation to educate and empower teenagers to, as one student wrote of his participation in the <em>AIDS 'N US PROJECT</em>, "Say AIDS in my own way."</p>

                        <p class="indent">The <em>AIDS 'N US PROJECT</em> was recognized nationally by The Center for Disease Control National AIDS Clearinghouse,</p>

                        <p class="indent">The idea for The Mourning Cards came spontaneously. Hector M. Corea was eighteen years old, and he was murdered. Yalidsa Ortiz mourned him. I encouraged her to write her thoughts down. She did, and I created a form for her writing, as a gift to family and friend of Hector M. Corea. When others saw the Mourning Card, they too wanted cards for their loved ones who had died. The Mourning Cards became another form for the writing of the young women in the Young Mother's Program, a form for the times as Brandi Pittman wrote, "I live in a world where love and happiness are rare. I live in a time where death is expected and living is strange."</p>

                        <p class="indent">These young people did not think they were capable of writing, never mind writing for publication. We worked hard together. We read, we talked, and they wrote and revised. I worked with so many young people
                          who were generous in spirit, and this anthology pays tribute to this quality.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="indent">These young people raise questions pertinent to all of us. There is a spiritual quality present in much of their writing, a vital and meditative spirituality that harkens back to Marcus Aurelius who asked in
                          one of his meditations, "With what art thou discontented?"&nbsp;</p>
