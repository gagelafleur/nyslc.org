A lack of knowledge of history was a major academic need identified by NYSLC early in its work with incarcerated youth, and as a result history became an important component of all of NYSLC&rsquo;s programs. The idea for creating a timeline evolved from the discussion at this meeting. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Dale Davis followed up on the discussion and zeroed in on the dates 1950 - 1970 for the political and social impact that people, places, and events from that time period have had on us. Dale Davis built the foundation and curriculum for </span><span class="c4">The Timeline Mural, 1950 &ndash; 1970</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;based upon NYLSC&rsquo;s belief that knowledge begins with knowing the students, the relevance of the information presented, and the student&rsquo;s ability to relate to the information. Research for the period, 1950 &ndash; 1970, included Rochester history, popular culture (i.e. number of television sets in the U.S.), music, health related inventions and treatment, and the Civil Rights movement. Dale Davis complied her research into an eleven-page document as a guideline for the project. A screening of the film &ldquo;July 64&rdquo; </span><span class="c7"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://itvs.org/films/july_64&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1567638233990000">https://itvs.org/films/july_64</a></span><span class="c9">&nbsp;on a computer was incorporated into the curriculum for </span><span class="c4">The Timeline Mural, 1950 - 1970</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;as were as some of photographs that were used in the film. The University of Rochester Rare Books, Special Collections, and Preservation provided copies of photographs for use in </span><span class="c4">The Timeline Mural, 1950 &ndash; 1970</span><span class="c9">. A graduate &nbsp;student, supervised by Dale Davis, worked at the Rochester Public Library to obtain copies of Rochester newspaper headlines and articles from 1950 &ndash; 1970. The headlines, articles, copies of images, copies of Rochester photos, stories, enabled the incarcerated students to manipulate and physically sequence the information while constructing the timeline with visual artist Margot Muto thereby increasing their academic engagement while simultaneously developing their problem solving and critical thinking skills. Former Rochester City Council Member At Large Dana Miller addressed the incarcerated youth with his personal reflections on growing up in Rochester in the time period to introduce the students to oral history. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Pedagogically the timeline format gave the incarcerated youth a chance to experience firsthand how many events simultaneously contribute to a historical period.&nbsp;The incarcerated youth worked with visual artist Margo Muto on four four foot boards to create the &nbsp;mural with visual synchronicity between the historical events. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">NYSLC is grateful to The University of Rochester Rare Books, Special Collections, and Preservation, the Rochester Public Library, and Dana Miller, Director of Development, Neighborhood and Business Development Rochester, New York for their help and support in the development of </span><span class="c4">The Timeline Mural, 1950 &ndash; 1970</span><span class="c9">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Timeline Mural, 1950 &ndash; 1970 </span><span class="c9">was located in Monroe County Jail adjacent to The Jimmy Santiago Baca Library, Writing, and Publishing Center, NYSLC&rsquo;s classroom, during the time NYSLC conducted programs for incarcerated youth at Monroe County Jail. It was not moved to Monroe Correctional Facility.
