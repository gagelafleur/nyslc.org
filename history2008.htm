          <strong>The Building of Ladders</strong><br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            I have seen first-hand how the streets eat childhoods.<br />
            There is no discrimination<br />
            just randomly picking whatever is around,<br />
            devouring it in one full swallow, and<br />
            spitting out any bones of humanity.&nbsp;<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            And I ask why,<br />
            and I rage at what I see,<br />
            and I cannot stop thinking why does this happen.<br />
            And I cannot stop thinking<br />
            why do we let this happen.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            I have seen the dreams in your eyes,<br />
            way back where you think you have hidden them,<br />
            I see them trying to grow,<br />
            trying to find light.<br />
            Where is the ladder for your dreams to climb?<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            I think what I mostly do is try to show you how to build ladders<br />
            that your dreams will be able to climb.<br />

            The third year of the New York State Literary Center's Incarcerated Education Program continued to be driven by the findings and success of its programs in Monroe County Jail and Monroe Correctional Facility, including the lower recidivism rate for those incarcerated youth participating in its programs.

          It began with the belief that learning is exciting and that a library of books relevant to incarcerated youths' identities, histories, with inspiration by those who have been incarcerated and who have turned their lives around through writing is important. It began with the belief that a space where incarcerated youth can come and read and write and be human, a place where the dreams in their hearts can grow and be nourished as they learn technology skills will increase literacy.<br /><br />
