          I feel my life is a war, living in a place that is really crazy. People die every day in Rochester, and all I can do is hope that it's not someone from my family or a close friend. Coming to jail has made me want to change my life around. I am happy to be where I am and not dead or hurt. I am learning new things. When I was going to school, I was mad at the officers for making me go to school every day or locking me in.  Then one day I came to school and a woman by the name of Dale Davis was there. She was talking about a lot of things, and I was like, "She really doesn't know what she's talking about." She was a white woman talking about rappers that I thought she didn't have a clue about. Then I went to The Jimmy Santiago Baca Library, Writing, and Publishing Center. For the first time it felt like I wasn't in jail the whole time I was there, but I was in jail. I learned there are really people who care about us young men. I didn't think people cared that much. It's not like our schools outside of jail. In The Jimmy Santiago Baca Library, Writing, and Publishing Center I see what I am really able to do and there is help there when I need it. It is easy to learn things there that I never in my lifetime thought I could do.

          In September 2009, <strong>Jimmy Santiago Baca</strong> donated a portion of his personal library to NYSLC's The Jimmy Santiago Baca Library, Writing, and Publishing Center at Monroe County Jail. Since Jimmy Santiago Baca is a major American writer many of the books he donated were personally signed to him, many were sent to him when he was a judge for national book awards, and many publishers sent him proof copies for blurbs.

          <strong>Melanie Hibbert</strong>, a video producer at Columbia University, contacted NYSLC in regard to her interest in looking at education programs in the justice system. "I know a couple of people who have been through the justice system, and education programs were very helpful to them," she emailed. She inquired about filming NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program. The Sheriff's Department granted permission, and Melanie Hibbert filmed at Monroe County Jail in February 2010. It was her hope that the video could help build support for programs like NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program.

				<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">

          In an effort to reach out to prisoners and educate people on both sides of the "wall,"&nbsp;<strong>The Anne Frank Center USA</strong>, in partnership with <strong>PEN American Center</strong>, launched a Prison Diary Program for men and women in American prisons using the Diary of Anne Frank as an inspirational tool. The program encouraged prisoners to utilize the same means of self-expression—writing a diary—that Anne used to endure her imprisonment while in hiding. The Anne Frank Center's diary writing program provided prisoners with a copy of A Diary of a Young Girl, a journal, and a pamphlet on diary writing and Anne Frank's literary accomplishments. Participants agreed to keep their own diaries, writing about their lives and thoughts, and returning their journals to The Anne Frank Center for possible publication on the Internet and in print.

The young men and women with whom I work in the New York State Literary Center's programs are adolescents who have been arrested as adults.

Existence means survival on the streets. If you hurt inside, really hurt because your father is not there, because you have witnessed your brother murdered, because a parent is in jail, you act out in school. Labels are easier than caring to find out why. Labels stick. In effect you are in a prison. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
