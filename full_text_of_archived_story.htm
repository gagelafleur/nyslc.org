            Writer-educator Dale Davis conducts a poetry workshop for city teens
            in juvenile detention, convinced that rap in the classroom raises
            literacy levels. She motivates students by telling them, &quot;You've got
            a book in you, maybe many books.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The <b>hip</b>-<b>hop</b> look doesn't do it for Dale Davis, who
            is in her late 50s, but she is a fan of rap. Earlier this month,
            Davis conducted a weeklong <b>hip</b>-<b>hop</b> poetry workshop at
            the St. Louis Juvenile Detention Center. Meeting for the first time
            with students at the center's Griscom School, Davis said, &quot;There is
            a stereotype you have to get over. I'm old, and I'm white. Now . . .
            we're moving on.&quot; </p>
            <p>That they did. At week's end, Davis had 20 pages of <b>hip</b>-<b>hop</b>
            poetry penned by the 40 teens. She also had a rough cut of the young
            poets reading their work, and soon each participant will have the
            finished CD. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&quot;Mainstream society neglects rhyme books full of <b>hip</b>-<b>hop</b>
            poetry, but enabling students to speak for themselves in their own
            language is increasingly important today, because too many of our
            students are alienated,&quot; Davis said in an interview before class.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A writer and educator based in Rochester, N.Y., Davis is vice
            president of the Association of Teaching Artists. She is convinced
            that using rap in the classroom raises literacy levels, encourages
            self-expression and motivates students, maybe even keeps them in
            school. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Calling rap &quot;among the most important influences in American
            youth culture today,&quot; Davis uses the rhyming poetry to motivate
            troubled adole scents to think, write and learn. &quot;I'm telling the
            students that, if an epic poem is a guide to civilization, the CD we
            are writing here will be a guide to St. Louis.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Midweek, eight young men barely old enough to drive -- all
            dressed in identical red sweats and and all awaiting hearings on
            crimes they have allegedly committed - filed into the library of the
            center, which is at 3847 Enright Avenue. Davis greeted them, handed
            out the lyrics to &quot;Moment of Clarity&quot; by rapper Jay-Z and then
            played the recording of the same name. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&quot;This is the time for your moment of clarity,&quot; Davis said
            afterward. &quot;When you're in the Juvenile Detention Facility, you have
            time to think, time to reflect. What do you see clearly? Later,
            we're going to write about that.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Davis told the students that DMX taught himself to write while in
            detention facilities in New York and that Black Ice learned to write
            at Rykers Island Prison, also in New York. She talked about the
            Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation's arts camp in Georgia. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Then Davis brought out an anthology of poetry by one of her
            former students, one of some 500 books Davis has published through
            the New York State Literary Center. Davis said she sells the books
            and gives the profits to the authors. She read aloud &quot;The Message&quot;
            and &quot;Ghetto Girl&quot; by Starmeisha Jones. The first poem begins: &quot;I
            don't feel a part of anything. I am unattached. I have no sense of
            belonging or security.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Nodding in appreciation - or maybe recognition - one young man
            said, &quot;That's nice.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Addressing a student in the front row, Davis said, &quot;You've got a
            book in you, maybe many books. You know that, right?&quot; Slouched in
            his chair and fiddling with a pencil, he allowed himself a small
            grin of pleasure. Another teen commented that poetry books by peers
            inspire other students. Everyone nodded. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Then, calling for silence in the room, Davis said, &quot;You must
            respect people when they read, because it's your heart and soul on
            the page.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One by one, pride triumphing over shyness, the young men moved to
            the front of the room to read work completed earlier in the week.
            The students applauded after each reading. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One poem, written by a student who said this was his first
            writing class, began like this: &quot;Small time gangsta doing wrong
            living out on the streets. Do you see a child, or do you see a man
            to be?&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another wrote: &quot;Life taught me to sell drugs, smoke, and show
            love, and run from the law, and if I get caught not to tell what I
            saw.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One teen penned a prayer in rhyme. Another's poem asked, &quot;Would I
            have been so messed up if a teacher hadn't told me to shut up, had
            listened to me, had helped me to read instead of seeing only hate?&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This work is not new to Davis. As a founder of the New York State
            Poets in the Schools program, Davis was asked in the late 1980s to
            write a play using writing by high school students. &quot;First I read
            their work. Then I started listening to their music,&quot; said Davis. &quot;I
            loved Public Enemy, and I started buying rap CDs and playing them in
            my car.&quot; That led to her develop the <b>hip</b>-<b>hop</b> poetry
            workshops 11 years ago. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Back in the classroom, Davis occasionally asked for a second
            reading, as this was a rehearsal for taping sessions scheduled later
            in the week. Sometimes, she encouraged &quot;bigger voices&quot; from the
            young men, who tended to speak softly. Some of them understood and
            complied, as some have taken part in &quot;I'm an Actor,&quot; an arts
            education program offered at the center through Prison Performing
            Arts, a local organization that works with incarcerated adults and
            children throughout Missouri. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Visitor Agnes Wilcox, artistic director of Prison Performing
            Arts, said, &quot;This <b>hip</b>-<b>hop</b> workshop has it all -
            literacy training, presentation skills, poetry exploration. It helps
            students gain a sense of accomplishment and self-respect.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Wilcox joined forces with Debbie Corson, arts education director
            at Young Audiences of St. Louis, to bring Davis to St. Louis. Their
            efforts were met with much enthusiasm. Allen Irving, superintendent
            of the Juvenile Detention Center, noted that Davis' program &quot;builds
            listening skills at the same time it taps into the students'
            talents.&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Next, Davis asked the teens to think back to Jay-Z's &quot;Moment of
            Clarity&quot; and to consider what they see clearly. She handed out
            paper, and, for 20 minutes, most of the teens wrote steadily. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One young man put down his pencil and said he couldn't do the
            assignment. In a simple exchange that is a measure of the workshop's
            success, a fellow student looked over at him and said, &quot;Try.&quot; </p>
