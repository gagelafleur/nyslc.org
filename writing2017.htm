									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t write much. I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s worth my time to write something down when I know no one will read it or care about it. I have much to say, but I don&rsquo;t know where to start. I feel like I wouldn&rsquo;t put a stray dog in my place, imprisonment and feeling I am losing my sanity. Perhaps freedom is sanity.</span></p>

									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m just a number here, and outside I have never made much of myself. I have to face the mistakes that left me where I am, rock bottom, broke, and homeless. </span></p>

									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know what the world expects of me, to get out only to start that cycle that many people know so well, spend half of my life, if not more, incarcerated, to rot away never realizing my potential. </span></p>
									    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest I am quite scared, afraid I won&rsquo;t be able to make it while staying a good, honest person. From my experience &ldquo;Good Guys Finish Last&rdquo; seems to be true. I see bad people getting what they want by walking over good people while I am wondering where is Karma. Is our world really this type of place? </span></p>

									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even while I am down though I see the good in others in this jail, an unlikely place. I have had many people help me out, and thanks to them I have the strength to try to be a better man.</span></p>

									    <p class="c3" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Today I sit here in the belly of the beast, Monroe Correctional Facility, serving nine months of a year back to back. I think about that day and the million and one ways my being here could have been avoided. I think about what could have prevented this nightmare. What I have come to learn is that in every situation there is time for consequential thinking. Every action has consequences, good or bad. Every time we make a decision there are results. </span></p>
									    <p
									        class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have made some horrible mistakes. I am human. Human beings make mistakes and mess up decisions. I apologize for all of the bad decisions I have made under the influence of drugs and alcohol that got me here. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of things. </span></p>
									    <p
									        class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I regret a lot of things I done under the influence of drugs and alcohol. </span></p>
									    <p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">To my grandkids, please know that you are wise and intelligent young men. I apologize to you for my ways and actions. I will try to be a better person for your sakes and for our family and friends.</span></p>

									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">To me education is a teaching and learning process and the key to some or all of the doors of success. Knowledge can be split into two words, know and ledge. Know yourself before you fall off the edge. You are the edge, and education will keep you away from walls and bars. Knowledge has no ending.</span></p>

									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The system is broken. When I am released from these mental and physical shackles, I am going to tell my grandkids and nephews and nieces that yes minds do matter especially those of Black incarcerated men who cannot vote due to a felony conviction. I want to tell them about how incarceration has changed my life, and without any form of education we are realizing the revolving door scenario. </span></p>
									    <p
									        class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would like to be able to look back and know that I have saved a young life from being a statistic. We who are incarcerated want to do something with our lives and not go in and out of a penitentiary. The United States has the highest rate of incarceration. Russia is second. We need to reduce the incarceration rate and spend money on education for inmates. </span></p>

									    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being incarcerated makes me invisible, and the whole time I am in plain sight. </span></p>
									    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">These walls and fences</span></p>

									    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hide my feelings and cry mentally. Being confined teaches me and others how to hide, or should I say disguise, our inner feelings. There&rsquo;s a saying that goes like this, &ldquo;A man with pride can be crushed more that a man without pride.&rdquo;</span></p>
									    <p
									        class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a young man with the disease formally know as depression, and when I am listening to my radio and looking at my grandkids&rsquo; photo depression kicks in, and I begin to shed invisible tears.

									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My great mistake is being here. What is the meaning of life? What is my purpose? What happened to my values? Why did I let outside influences decide what was good for me and how to life my life and what I needed or didn&rsquo;t need to do?</span></p>

Because of this I feel like breaking down, but to me showing that side of my feelings is a sign of weakness and where I come from we just don&#39;t do that. I never liked letting people see that side of me. I became a master of how to hide my feelings. People think I am always happy, but really I am a man who is depressed inside and no one will ever know because I have too much pride to let anyone see me cry.</span></p>

									    <p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Right now is scary. I think of what this country could look like in the next few years. We may have a Supreme Court that could eliminate our rights. Where do we go from here? Right now I know I need to do all I can as a citizen to join my voice to others to oppose this new order. </span></p>
									    <p
									        class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c9">I have had to sit on the sidelines and just watch helplessly. I had no say in who became the 45</span><span class="c9 c14">th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;President of the United States because I was not able to vote. Are the protests and the riots signs of the end of our country? </span></p>

									    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I believe my teachers in school could have done more, and I could have applied myself more. Teachers should have believed in me and encouraged me to go further. Knowing what I know now I wish I could have gone on to college.</span></p>
									    <p
									        class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">What I would like to learn more about is education helping incarcerated men and women not come back to jail and move forward with their lives. </span></p>
									    <p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The justice system is broken, and education would benefit us and lower the recidivism rate. Hopefully college credits will be able to be incorporated into county jails someday. </span></p>
									    <p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I would love to look back one day and be able to talk to young adults about not making the same mistake I did when I was younger. I would like incarceration to change lives for the better and instead of making us better criminals make us productive members of society. I believe it would help those incarcerated tremendously to be able to get college credits while incarcerated. </span></p>

									    <p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">What I have been writing explains a lot about how I feel about the justice system and my education and how the education system and teachers could have pushed me harder like they did other students. I feel like I was cheated. I needed teachers to believe in me. </span></p>
									    <p
									        class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">How I am perceived by my peers means a lot to me because I like to be accepted by everyone. I know that&rsquo;s not possible. I really don&rsquo;t know where I belong in the world right now. One thing I do know is that I have a meaning or purpose in the world. What it is I don&rsquo;t know yet. </span></p>
									    <p
									        class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The world I live in could be more aware of helping those less fortunate, help all of us to succeed and reach our goals. I want to go to college badly but deep down inside I&rsquo;m scared. I want to succeed but failure is a big fear for me. It hurts to fail. </span></p>

									    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sadness and sorrow and pain are so hard to express. Is the only way for us to express our inner feelings and thoughts by writing a song or a poem? </span></p>
									    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
									    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After hearing our writing is it hard for you to believe that some of us have only seventh grade educations? Our writing makes me think about education and educating myself and others. Our writing gives me inspiration to continue my own education </span></p>
