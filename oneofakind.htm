				one-of-a-kind program with incarcerated youth is bringing some 
				hope through art. </font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial">A mural was created by teens at the Monroe 
				County Correctional Facility in Brighton. The Rochester City 
				School District's Youth and Justice Program&nbsp;teamed up with The 
				New York State Literary Center. </font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial">The mural is much more than art -- it has 
				a message. The instructor says at first, most of the youth 
				approached the project saying they couldn't do it. In the end, 
				it helped the teens work through their struggles. </font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial">RCSD Instructor Eva Zweifler said, 
				&quot;Through the process of them reading, writing, drawing, talking, 
				they actually could and they actually produced and they actually 
				became very successful despite what they were thinking they were 
				going to do.&quot;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial">You can find the murals in the visiting 
				areas of the Monroe County Jail downtown and the correctional 
				facility in Brighton. </font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial">The arts education partnership is The New 
				York State Literary Center, Rochester City School Districts's 
				Youth and Justice Program, in collaboration with the Monroe 
				County Sheriff's Office.</font></p>
