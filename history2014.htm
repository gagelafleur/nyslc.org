          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The ninth year of the New York State Literary Center's Incarcerated Education Program began with a survey of incarcerated adults in NYSLC's classes at Monroe Correctional Facility asking them to identify what was important to them and what they would like to learn more about. Through their written responses and in classroom discussion, children and the issues and experiences relevant to the incarceration of a parent stood out. This led to NYSLC to initiate <strong>Rebuilding Families</strong>. <strong>Dale Davis</strong> began with a <strong>Reading List</strong> on the effects of incarceration on children whose parents are incarcerated <a href="https://www.nyslc.org/ReadinglistNinthYear.htm" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.nyslc.org/ReadinglistNinthYear.htm</a>.</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Until now I didn't realize that my 9-year-old son is also doing time. Me, he, she, everyone I love is suffering. The months I will spend in here are time I will never be able to get back. It's gone. This is the first and last time I will be unavailable to my son. My sister did 4 years in prison, and it destroyed her kids' lives and my mother's relationship with her. When I get out I want to be the best father I can be.</font></span></p>

          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">NYSLC's research continued to confirm the dissolution of families, the harm to children who have to give up their homes, their safety, their self-image, their anger, and the resultant perpetuation of the cycle of crime and incarceration from one generation to the next as one of most significant collateral consequences of the prison population in the United States. Children are more likely to become homeless, drop out of school, suffer significantly higher rates of behavioral and mental-health problems, most notably aggression, suffer from anxiety and attention deficient disorders, engage in delinquent behavior, and subsequently be incarcerated themselves (Christopher Wildeman and Sara Wakefield. "Children of The Prison Boom: Mass Incarceration and the Future of American Inequality." Oxford University Press, 2013 <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/679754?mobileUi=0&amp;"  style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/679754?mobileUi=0&amp;</a> and Kristin Turney.

          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A survey conducted by New York State Criminal Justice Services in 2013, constructed to assess incarcerated parents' plans to reunite with their children, found the most widely reported anticipated barrier to reunification was the need to rebuild the relationship with the child. The survey provided data driven support for programs addressing the need to build the capacity to address parent/child relationships prior to and after the parent returns home ("Children of Incarcerated Parents In New York State A Data Analysis," New York State Division of Criminal Justice, 2013).&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><strong>Rebuilding Families</strong> began here. The continuing research and writing and discussion in NYSLC's two classrooms, discussion with <strong>Rochester Broadway Theater League</strong>'s Chief Operating Officer, John Parkhurst, and Education/Outreach Director, Bob Sagan, and input from the Office of The Sheriff were the foundation for a pilot with the <strong>Rochester Broadway Theater League</strong> to reunite incarcerated parents in NYSLC's Incarcerated Education Program with their families through classroom readings and writing assignments while incarcerated and a shared experience attending a Broadway musical upon their release to reduce the impact of incarceration on children and to rebuild and reaffirm the family following incarceration.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><strong>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</strong> was a publication to reach out with the thoughts and ideas of those incarcerated and housed at Monroe Correctional Facility. "Our writing reflects un-imprisoned minds doing time."</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In my community people don't see me. At times I feel as if I am a burden to society due to the simple fact that I was not employed for the year and a half that I engaged in criminal activities to remain stable.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I know I can be a great help, influence, and voice in my community if I chose to do the right things with my life and continue my education. The lack of jobs and opportunities make me despise my community. Stigmas and discrimination make me hate the establishment and give up. Poverty made me feel as if I had nothing to lose so why not risk my freedom for the things I needed but couldn't afford.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In my community I am no one. I am a mother struggling and living in poverty.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Writing for <strong>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</strong> gives me time to think and to express myself. It has given me a voice and a desire to change and make an impact. I'm learning that yes I may have done wrong and yes I am incarcerated, but this does not hinder me from thinking and from having an opinion on a topic that is dire in our community. Someone can only know poverty if she has lived it and gone hungry first hand.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The <strong>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</strong> group has me reconsidering my thought process about poverty, parenting, incarceration, and our community. It has opened my eyes to the vulnerability one feels when they succumb to poverty. How susceptible one is to incarceration by any means. Many may think otherwise but fighting poverty sometimes involves incarceration. It is simply a survival tactic.</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I have learned to voice my concerns, admit my wrongs, and advocate for change.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style = "padding-left:25px;">
          <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">No one ever asked me these questions. No one asked me if I needed help. Many have seen me steal, but no one has ever given me a hand. No one has asked me what I need. The system didn't give me a chance. It took me from my children. No one wants to hear me express myself. Everyone wants to see me punished.</font></span></p>
