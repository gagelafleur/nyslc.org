          The incarcerated youth next worked with musician and engineer Jeremy DeGroat learning music software to teach them to use
          the latest technology to compose original music for their writing for the CD. Dale Davis produced a CD at each site:
          <strong>Tragic Minds Locked Up</strong> was produced and recorded at Monroe County Jail and
