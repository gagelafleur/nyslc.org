				<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">This program is good
				because. It helps people to get to know us better, not just look
				at us as just inmates or bad kids. People are so quick to judge
				you by their first impression, but this program lets people in
				on things that people don�t know about us and that most of us
				don�t share. And it might change the way people look at us.
				People judge a book by the cover, but you don�t know what that
				book is about until you read it.<br>

				I like to write because it helps me to express my feelings. It
				is easier to write to get out stuff than to talk about it.
				Writing also takes my mind off the stressful things. It makes my
				time and days go by fast, and it stops me from thinking about
				what the judge is going to do or say when I get court again. I
				think about what�s going on in the world on the outside.
				Sometimes I try to sleep all day, but I can�t. Doing the same
				thing everyday makes me want to be a locked in. I wish I could
				have a big plate of home cooked food, lie in a big bed, and
				chill with my friends again. Writing helps me to ask myself was
				it worth it.<br>

				<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Music in jail? Maybe
				on your small commissary radio, but that�s about it. To me
				playing music is limited to whatever can come out of your mouth
				or be banged on the table. The drums and other percussion
				instruments that were provided to us were a very good way for
				some of my problems. I felt like I was actually doing something
				good for a change. That is not always so easy when you�re in a
				place like jail. You almost lose hope at times, but while I was
				in the drum class it was the complete opposite. There was not a
				second where we were not smiling. Also the cooperation that was
				needed to create such a synchronized rhythm is a rare thing. I
				think if I had something like this to do while I was free it
				could prevent me form getting into trouble. I would really enjoy
				a type of music transitional class when I return home. Thank you
				for allowing us to have the steel drum class it was a very good
				time, I learned a lot, and I would recommend it to anyone who
				likes music. Pleas make this program available for others.<br>
