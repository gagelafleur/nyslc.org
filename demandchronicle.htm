				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">She believes that writing is one
				of the tools we need to make a better life � not just to get a
				job, but to make sense of the world and our place in it. </font>
				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">She takes her students where they
				are. Her medium is hip hop � &quot;the most powerful form of
				communication there is for young people,&quot; she says. Even street
				kids who can barely read or write can rhyme and can tell a
				story, she says. </font>
				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">The writing program, The
				Communication Project, is run by the New York State Literacy
				Center, which Davis co-founded in 1979, and is funded by the
				National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council
				on the Arts. </font>
				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">Over the years, Davis' students
				have showcased their work on CDs and in small picture books.
				&quot;They want a voice,&quot; she says. &quot;They want people to listen.&quot;
				</font>
				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">Hip hop is not an end in itself,
				but the means to an end. There is a connection between violence
				and a shortage of language skills. Language helps us define our
				world and control it. Without it, we have chaos � which is
				fertile ground for violence. </font>
				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I'm not Kanye West,&quot; she tells
				them. &quot;But he's not coming here. You'll have to work with an old
				white woman.&quot; And they do.<BR><BR>She encourages them to write
				rap lyrics, &quot;but there are boundaries,&quot; which is part of the
				lesson. Davis wants them to write about life in Rochester, but
				they cannot celebrate guns or violence or sexual exploitation.
				</font>
				<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Their writing is true to their
				lives. It is not always uplifting. Here are a few examples.<BR>
				<BR>From a song titled, &quot;These are My Final Words:&quot;<BR><BR>
				</font><I><font size="2" face="Arial">I do not fear </font>
				<P><font size="2" face="Arial">My age is twenty,</font></I><font face="Arial" size="2"><BR>
				<BR><I>and I don't think I will ever know</I><BR><BR><I>when
				death is near.</I><BR><BR><I>And when I die</I><BR><BR><I>my
				spirit will be free as a bird.</I><BR><BR></font><I>
				<font size="2" face="Arial">You don't have to read this twice
				</font>
				<P><font size="2" face="Arial">because these are my final words.</font></I><font face="Arial" size="2"><BR>
				<BR>This is from &quot;Why I write:&quot;<BR><BR><I>I write to relieve
				stress,</I><BR><BR><I>to take away the pain,</I><BR><BR></font>
				<I><font size="2" face="Arial">to not keep things in... </font>
				<P><font size="2" face="Arial">My mom and dad were on drugs</font></I><font face="Arial" size="2"><BR>
				<BR><I>My mom and dad</I><BR><BR><I>never paid any attention to
				me...</I><BR><BR><I>Every night they brought me everything I
				wanted,</I><BR><BR></font><I><font size="2" face="Arial">but the
				precious thing I needed </font>
				<P><font size="2" face="Arial">was their love.</font></I><font size="2" face="Arial"><BR>
				<BR>Another explains in a letter why he wants to write:<BR><BR>
				&quot;When I write I think about my dreams becoming reality ... So I
				write 'cause I know if I write about everything, how can the
				pain remain? It can't. It won't. 'Cause when I write, I shall
				never fall! I'll tell the world that I'm a winner no matter
				what!&quot; </font>
				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">Writing is a tool; it's an
				opportunity. When they first start to put their words on paper,
				the lyrics are riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. &quot;I
				put them all in the computer; I fix all of them and return
				them,&quot; Davis says. &quot;I don't correct the students.&quot; </font>
				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">But she wants them to learn the
				rules because proper grammar and spelling enable readers to
				understand them.<BR><BR>Writing is hope. &quot;It's their first
				chance at reflective thinking,&quot; she says. &quot;On the streets, it's
				hustle all the time. No time to think.&quot; </font>
				<P><font face="Arial" size="2">There are no guarantees of
				success for these students, just a chance. A chance they've
				never had before. </font>
