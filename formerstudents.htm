                          been through the same struggle. We have made it easier for each other. I respect everyone who took the time to share their stories. The best thing was having someone who cares about us open our minds and make us understand

                          thought it was over. Then I went to The Jimmy Santiago Baca
                          Library, Writing, and Publishing Center and started to write. I
                          wrote about the streets and my brother's death and my time in

                          program lets people in on things that people don't know about us and that most of us don't share. And it might change the way people look at us. People judge a book by the cover, but you don't know what that book is about

                          I wish I could have a big plate of home cooked food, lie in a big bed, and chill with my friends again. Writing helps me to ask myself was it worth it. </font>

                          a home where there was hardly any love shown, I sheltered myself
                          from growing. So much was going on in my life and through the
                          experiences, it only got worse. Finally when I was sixteen yrs
                          old, I was sent to St. Joseph's Villa. No one ever wants to
                          admit that being in lock up changes your life from a whole
                          different perspective, but I can admit that I would probably be
                          dead or in jail if I didn't go. But even though I was in a whole
                          new world, I still wasn't able to express myself the way that I
                          really wanted to.</font>

                        <font face="Arial" size="2">I remember
                          when we were being told by our staff that someone from NYSLC was
                          coming to work with some of the teens for a project. At first&nbsp;I
                          didn't want to&nbsp;participate because I thought that it was just
                          another excuse for us to be away from the cottage. We later
                          learned that NYSLC was an organization that gave youth the
                          chance to be heard and to express themselves. I decided to
                          participate and I'm so glad I did. For those few weeks that Dale
                          Davis was there with us, I felt like I could express myself no
                          matter what anyone said or thought. I've always written poems
                          but I never shared any of them with anyone and they were usually
                          short and dinky lol but they meant a whole great deal to me.
                          Dale taught us how to express ourselves in a way that I wasn't
                          used to. We would write our poems about how we felt, the
                          experiences we've been through, and so much more and actually
                          share them with the other kids in the program. It was different
                          for me, but I appreciated it so much. The program sort of put me
                          in the mindset of Def Poetry Jam. It was so much fun. In The
                          Villa, they were very strict on things we could and could not do
                          or say and while Dale was there I felt so comfortable because I
                          was able to express myself without worrying about getting in
                          trouble. It helped me a lot to come to terms with my past and to
                          realize that things could've been a lot worse. I wasn't scared
                          to say what I felt anymore. I was actually able to communicate
                          better with others after the program. I wanted to be heard and I
                          finally was. It was an amazing moment for me.</font>

                          us was coming from and understood what we were going through. We
                          were able to help each other cope with the anger and pain we
                          were enduring deep down inside. It was a wonderful experience
                          for me and I carry that with me till this day. I changed a lot
                          of my ways and became so much more mature, less angry, and more
                          uplifting. I am so thankful for Dale and NYSLC for helping me
                          cope with my troubles and helping me make it through with no
                          worries. Love you guys to death. Keep up the good work and
                          continue to reach out to the youth. You guys are a blessing!&nbsp;</font>

                          recently incarcerated at Monroe Correctional Facility I was
                          introduced to the New York State Literary Center. I think this
                          is an awesome organization. This is a wonderful way for us as
                          young adults to express our feelings and beliefs on our everyday
                          life. The incarcerated staff and so many people look at us as
                          criminals. With the New York State Literary Center, we have a
                          chance to show and express ourselves positively as humans and
                          not just as an ID number. After my first time meeting with me
                          Ms. Dale Davis I was very interested in the program. She's a
                          wonderful person. The next day I was introduced to another
                          wonderful artist who explained to us how the program worked and
                          the kind of art we will be doing. The more I learned about NYSLC
                          the more I was ready to get involved in the class. The problem
                          is I'm being released from custody and won't be able to
                          participate in the program, which isn't fair! I asked Ms. Dale
                          Davis was there any organization like this put together that is
                          not inside of a correctional facility. It surprised me that a
                          wonderful program like this should just be in jails. I believe
                          if there was a program like this created in the community it
                          really would make a change. There are plenty of young adults who
                          have been in jail and plenty of children who would love to join
                          a community classroom like the NYSLC. It gives us an opportunity
                          to learn, to have fun and express our feelings all at the same
                          time. For instance, I'm not good at drawing and I hate
                          expressing my feelings to others. With the self-portraits and
                          the art of collage, it really gave me a chance to express myself
                          in several different ways. </font>

                          for funds if needed to get the program up and running. Thanks

                          I'm a young African American male from southwest Rochester, New York who has been through terrible things in my life. Lots of murders happened in my only eighteen years. My friend was killed in front of my face when I was
                          fourteen, and I was shot in the leg and shocked by the scene. I never can stop thinking about that day, April 11, 2007. I hate the life I have lived after that day because my life was almost taken, and I think about that
                          every day. My mother had to raise me all alone for all of my life. My father was shot and murdered when I was young, and that, plus what happened to me, scarred my mother forever. I made mistakes I know, and now I am trying
                          to do something about it. I dropped out of school, and I am pushing to get a GED. I want to look forward to going to college. I want to believe I can go to college. I want an education. I want to work to help my mother with
                          the bills.

                              After being incarcerated in 2015, I felt embarrassed for leaving my family to fend for themselves.
                              Not only did I let myself down, I forced my family to suffer the consequences of my choices and
                              not their own. After it was all over I was grateful they choose to stick by my side the whole six
                              months I spent in jail. Shortly into my time, I met Dale Davis, who taught a New York State
                              Literary Center writing program in the jail. I was happy for this opportunity, little did I
                              understand at the time the impact the program would have on my life."

                              From the beginning we were given assignments and the materials to complete them. Along with
                              books and articles to read and research, we were given writing by famous authors and historical
                              literature to read. The New York State Literary Center program came through. It created an
                              environment where we could feel proud despite our temporary circumstances by laying the
                              foundation and building the tools necessary to create better opportunities for ourselves that
                              would serve as a positive in our communities and not a negative.

                              All of my family went to my grandmother's for Christmas, all eight daughters and one son. All
                              eight daughters and the one son would bring their own children. The house was full. We all ate
                              as we came, and you would not want to be the last because you would eat the scraps. The food,
                              arroz con grandules, vianda and bacalao, pernil, pollo, arroz blanco, flan, biscochas, arros con
                              dulce, pasteles, coquito, and pastelillos, and quesitos. All of the food was good, and we all had a little of everything on our plates. Kids ran everywhere. Jokes were told. Laughter filled the room. New additions were passed from hand to hand. Pictures were taken and the small children were angry from posing for so long. My grandparents were so happy and love ran through their home. Now my grandparents have
                              gone to Heaven. The tradition is no longer the same, but the food always remains the same in
                              each of my aunts' and my uncle's homes. Now we drive to each home and pick up the food.

                              I have lived in Rochester, New York ever since birth. Don't get me wrong I left about three or
                              four times to move out of state and, also, to go to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is part of the United States, yet I consider myself a minority. I know first-hand the poverty problem we have in Rochester, New York and also in Puerto Rico. The cost of living is rising, and jobs don't pay enough. Many mothers are single mothers and day care costs are so high that unfortunately many children are going hungry at night. Kids are growing up mostly to deal drugs and to steal. As children turn into teens, incarceration begins and families begin to deteriorate. Children without mothers, mothers without children, fathers without families
                              and the government laughs. Slavery is still in play after all of these years.

                              I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for the work that you do with children! I had the pleasure of taking a creative writing class with you years ago (mid/late 90s) at Alternative High School in Fairport. I was
                              in
                              a district based classroom across the parking lot at the Foreman Center, and a few of us were given the opportunity to join your class - I had always loved writing poetry, but never felt that I had an unbiased open
                              environment in which to express my feelings. The way you connected with the kids really has stood out to me after all these years.
                              At the time I was really into Nirvana, the Grateful Dead, and Marilyn Manson - quite the combination! You allowed me and a classmate to dissect our favorite songs by Marilyn Manson and write about them from our
                              perspective
                              in an effort to educate parents about why they shouldn't just blame the music for all their child's problems. You also recommended that I read Polaroids from the Dead by Douglas Coupland, which is still a favorite of
                              mine
                              today! As an adult with my own child now, I have come to realize the mostly thankless work that so many educators dedicate themselves to. As I pulled out Douglas Coupland again this week for another read, I thought of
                              you
                              (and searched for you!) and am so glad to see you are still churning away and making a difference in people's lives!

                              I want to start by saying thank you. My family wants to thank Dale Davis, the New York State Literary Center, and all the people at the Strong National Museum of Play for donating the tickets to us. In my time of
                              incarceration we are grateful for this blessing to give my family a chance to go to such an awesome place. My kids totally enjoyed the Butterfly Garden and all of the cool attractions in the museum. They told me they
                              had a
                              great time. They were amazed at how I got tickets for such a cool place. When I told them they could not believe that something so good could come from a place like jail. My kids are older so they kind of understand my
                              situation and the kind of place I am in. They worry, but seeing something so nice can come from a place like this gave them an ease of mind.

                              I ask myself everyday why did I choose the life I chose. I have two felonies. What jobs will there be for me, a two-time felon? Some days I just sit on my bunk and think of ways to try to correct my life because I know
                              if I
                              give up I will either be dead or in prison. I can't give up. I have a lot of people who love me. I can't live the way I was because I always get the same results, and I am so tired of coming in this revolving door. From
                              here on out I made a vow to myself to never come back to this place again. I know it will take a lot of hard work. I am determined to change for me and my two little girls. Honestly Ms. Dale is the person who I sit back
                              and
                              listen to. She is such a positive person, and she sees good in everyone. She honestly made me want to do better and become a better person. I want to say thank you to her.

                              In this county and state we have a need for The New York State Literary Center with Dale Davis. We need this organization not only for inmates, but also for our society and for communities across the state. The Community Engagement Seminar with Dale Davis has been the only rehabilitation I have had since being here at Monroe Correctional Facility.
