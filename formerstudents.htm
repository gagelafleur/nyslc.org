				dead or in jail if I didn't go. But even though I was in a whole

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I remember
				when we were being told by our staff that someone from NYSLC was
				coming to work with some of the teens for a project. At first&nbsp;I
				didn't want to&nbsp;participate because I thought that it was just
				another excuse for us to be away from the cottage. We later
				learned that NYSLC was an organization that gave youth the
				chance to be heard and to express themselves. I decided to
				participate and I'm so glad I did. For those few weeks that Dale
				Davis was there with us, I felt like I could express myself no
				matter what anyone said or thought. I've always written poems
				but I never shared any of them with anyone and they were usually
				short and dinky lol but they meant a whole great deal to me.
				Dale taught us how to express ourselves in a way that I wasn't
				used to. We would write our poems about how we felt, the
				experiences we've been through, and so much more and actually
				share them with the other kids in the program. It was different
				for me, but I appreciated it so much. The program sort of put me
				in the mindset of Def Poetry Jam. It was so much fun. In The
				Villa, they were very strict on things we could and could not do
				or say and while Dale was there I felt so comfortable because I
				was able to express myself without worrying about getting in
				trouble. It helped me a lot to come to terms with my past and to
				realize that things could've been a lot worse. I wasn't scared
				to say what I felt anymore. I was actually able to communicate
				better with others after the program. I wanted to be heard and I
				finally was. It was an amazing moment for me.</span></p>

				and&nbsp;I still have the Roc City Anthem CD. I listen to it when I'm
				reminiscing about old times, and it always reminds me of how I
				can always relate to others in more ways then I can even
				imagine. All of the experiences the kids and I in the project
				had been through, from poverty, to sex, to drugs, violence,
				neglect, every negative thing you can possibly think of, came
				together in one movement. It was like we knew where each one&nbsp;of
				us was coming from and understood what we were going through. We
				were able to help each other cope with the anger and pain we
				were enduring deep down inside. It was a wonderful experience
				for me and I carry that with me till this day. I changed a lot
				of my ways and became so much more mature, less angry, and more
				uplifting. I am so thankful for Dale and NYSLC for helping me
				cope with my troubles and helping me make it through with no
				worries. Love you guys to death. Keep up the good work and
				continue to reach out to the youth. You guys are a blessing!&nbsp;</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">When I was
				recently incarcerated at Monroe Correctional Facility I was
				introduced to the New York State Literary Center. I think this
				is an awesome organization. This is a wonderful way for us as
				young adults to express our feelings and beliefs on our everyday
				life. The incarcerated staff and so many people look at us as
				criminals. With the New York State Literary Center, we have a
				chance to show and express ourselves positively as humans and
				not just as an ID number. After my first time meeting with me
				Ms. Dale Davis I was very interested in the program. She's a
				wonderful person. The next day I was introduced to another
				wonderful artist who explained to us how the program worked and
				the kind of art we will be doing. The more I learned about NYSLC
				the more I was ready to get involved in the class. The problem
				is I'm being released from custody and won't be able to
				participate in the program, which isn't fair! I asked Ms. Dale
				Davis was there any organization like this put together that is
				not inside of a correctional facility. It surprised me that a
				wonderful program like this should just be in jails. I believe
				if there was a program like this created in the community it
				really would make a change. There are plenty of young adults who
				have been in jail and plenty of children who would love to join
				a community classroom like the NYSLC. It gives us an opportunity
				to learn, to have fun and express our feelings all at the same
				time. For instance, I'm not good at drawing and I hate
				expressing my feelings to others. With the self-portraits and
				the art of collage, it really gave me a chance to express myself
				in several different ways. </span></p>

				for your time and appreciation. Hope to hear something soon!</span></p>

          After being incarcerated in 2015, I felt embarrassed for leaving my family to fend for themselves.
  Not only did I let myself down, I forced my family to suffer the consequences of my choices and
  not their own. After it was all over I was grateful they choose to stick by my side the whole six
  months I spent in jail. Shortly into my time, I met Dale Davis, who taught a New York State
  Literary Center writing program in the jail. I was happy for this opportunity, little did I
  understand at the time the impact the program would have on my life."

          From the beginning we were given assignments and the materials to complete them. Along with
books and articles to read and research, we were given writing by famous authors and historical
literature to read. The New York State Literary Center program came through. It created an
environment where we could feel proud despite our temporary circumstances by laying the
foundation and building the tools necessary to create better opportunities for ourselves that
would serve as a positive in our communities and not a negative.

          I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for the work that you do with children!  I had the pleasure of taking a creative writing class with you years ago (mid/late 90s) at Alternative High School in Fairport.  I was in a district based classroom across the parking lot at the Foreman Center, and a few of us were given the opportunity to join your class - I had always loved writing poetry, but never felt that I had an unbiased open environment in which to express my feelings.  The way you connected with the kids really has stood out to me after all these years.
At the time I was really into Nirvana, the Grateful Dead, and Marilyn Manson - quite the combination!  You allowed me and a classmate to dissect our favorite songs by Marilyn Manson and write about them from our perspective in an effort to educate parents about why they shouldn't just blame the music for all their child's problems.  You also recommended that I read Polaroids from the Dead by Douglas Coupland, which is still a favorite of mine today!  As an adult with my own child now, I have come to realize the mostly thankless work that so many educators dedicate themselves to.  As I pulled out Douglas Coupland again this week for another read, I thought of you (and searched for you!) and am so glad to see you are still churning away and making a difference in people's lives!

        I want to start by saying thank you. My family wants to thank Dale Davis, the New York State Literary Center, and all the people at the Strong National Museum of Play for donating the tickets to us. In my time of incarceration we are grateful for this blessing to give my family a chance to go to such an awesome place. My kids totally enjoyed the Butterfly Garden and all of the cool attractions in the museum. They told me they had a great time. They were amazed at how I got tickets for such a cool place. When I told them they could not believe that something so good could come from a place like jail. My kids are older so they kind of understand my situation and the kind of place I am in. They worry, but seeing something so nice can come from a place like this gave them an ease of mind.

        I ask myself everyday why did I choose the life I chose. I have two felonies. What jobs will there be for me, a two-time felon? Some days I just sit on my bunk and think of ways to try to correct my life because I know if I give up I will either be dead or in prison. I can’t give up. I have a lot of people who love me. I can’t live the way I was because I always get the same results, and I am so tired of coming in this revolving door. From here on out I made a vow to myself to never come back to this place again. I know it will take a lot of hard work. I am determined to change for me and my two little girls. Honestly Ms. Dale is the person who I sit back and listen to. She is such a positive person, and she sees good in everyone. She honestly made me want to do better and become a better person. I want to say thank you to her.
