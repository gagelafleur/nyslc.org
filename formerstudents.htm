				thought it was over. Then I went to The Jimmy Santiago Baca 
				Library, Writing, and Publishing Center and started to write. I 
				wrote about the streets and my brother's death and my time in

				one year now, and now I know when I die I don't want people 
				crying. I want people to smile and say he was a good writer. His

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Coming from 
				a home where there was hardly any love shown, I sheltered myself 
				from growing. So much was going on in my life and through the 
				experiences, it only got worse. Finally when I was sixteen yrs 
				old, I was sent to St. Joseph's Villa. No one ever wants to 
				admit that being in lock up changes your life from a whole 
				different perspective, but I can admit that I would probably be 
				dead or in jail if I didn't go. But even though I was in a whole 
				new world, I still wasn't able to express myself the way that I 
				really wanted to.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I remember 
				when we were being told by our staff that someone from NYSLC was 
				coming to work with some of the teens for a project. At first&nbsp;I 
				didn't want to&nbsp;participate because I thought that it was just 
				another excuse for us to be away from the cottage. We later 
				learned that NYSLC was an organization that gave youth the 
				chance to be heard and to express themselves. I decided to 
				participate and I'm so glad I did. For those few weeks that Dale 
				Davis was there with us, I felt like I could express myself no 
				matter what anyone said or thought. I've always written poems 
				but I never shared any of them with anyone and they were usually 
				short and dinky lol but they meant a whole great deal to me. 
				Dale taught us how to express ourselves in a way that I wasn't 
				used to. We would write our poems about how we felt, the 
				experiences we've been through, and so much more and actually 
				share them with the other kids in the program. It was different 
				for me, but I appreciated it so much. The program sort of put me 
				in the mindset of Def Poetry Jam. It was so much fun. In The 
				Villa, they were very strict on things we could and could not do 
				or say and while Dale was there I felt so comfortable because I 
				was able to express myself without worrying about getting in 
				trouble. It helped me a lot to come to terms with my past and to 
				realize that things could've been a lot worse. I wasn't scared 
				to say what I felt anymore. I was actually able to communicate 
				better with others after the program. I wanted to be heard and I 
				finally was. It was an amazing moment for me.</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">That was 
				almost six years ago. I am now&nbsp;almost twenty-two years old, 
				and&nbsp;I still have the Roc City Anthem CD. I listen to it when I'm 
				reminiscing about old times, and it always reminds me of how I 
				can always relate to others in more ways then I can even 
				imagine. All of the experiences the kids and I in the project 
				had been through, from poverty, to sex, to drugs, violence, 
				neglect, every negative thing you can possibly think of, came 
				together in one movement. It was like we knew where each one&nbsp;of 
				us was coming from and understood what we were going through. We 
				were able to help each other cope with the anger and pain we 
				were enduring deep down inside. It was a wonderful experience 
				for me and I carry that with me till this day. I changed a lot 
				of my ways and became so much more mature, less angry, and more 
				uplifting. I am so thankful for Dale and NYSLC for helping me 
				cope with my troubles and helping me make it through with no 
				worries. Love you guys to death. Keep up the good work and 
				continue to reach out to the youth. You guys are a blessing!&nbsp;</span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">When I was 
				recently incarcerated at Monroe Correctional Facility I was 
				introduced to the New York State Literary Center. I think this 
				is an awesome organization. This is a wonderful way for us as 
				young adults to express our feelings and beliefs on our everyday 
				life. The incarcerated staff and so many people look at us as 
				criminals. With the New York State Literary Center, we have a 
				chance to show and express ourselves positively as humans and 
				not just as an ID number. After my first time meeting with me 
				Ms. Dale Davis I was very interested in the program. She’s a 
				wonderful person. The next day I was introduced to another 
				wonderful artist who explained to us how the program worked and 
				the kind of art we will be doing. The more I learned about NYSLC 
				the more I was ready to get involved in the class. The problem 
				is I’m being released from custody and won’t be able to 
				participate in the program, which isn’t fair! I asked Ms. Dale 
				Davis was there any organization like this put together that is 
				not inside of a correctional facility. It surprised me that a 
				wonderful program like this should just be in jails. I believe 
				if there was a program like this created in the community it 
				really would make a change. There are plenty of young adults who 
				have been in jail and plenty of children who would love to join 
				a community classroom like the NYSLC. It gives us an opportunity 
				to learn, to have fun and express our feelings all at the same 
				time. For instance, I’m not good at drawing and I hate 
				expressing my feelings to others. With the self-portraits and 
				the art of collage, it really gave me a chance to express myself 
				in several different ways. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I really 
				think there should be a discussion about opening a “community” 
				classroom in the “community”. I would even help run a fundraiser 
				for funds if needed to get the program up and running. Thanks 
				for your time and appreciation. Hope to hear something soon!</span></p>
