The first idea was acceptance, the acceptance, totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are: in light of this idea, it goes without saying that injustice is commonplace. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c9">But this does not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea was of equal power: that one must never, in one&rsquo;s own life, accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one&rsquo;s strength. This fight begins, however, in the heart and it has now been laid to my charge to keep my own heart free of hatred and despair. This intimation made my heart heavy and, now that my father was irrecoverable, I wished that he had been inside me so that I could have searched his face for the answers which only the future would give me now.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1 c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1 c9">James Baldwin. &ldquo;Notes of a Native Son.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1 c9 c5">The Price of The Ticket</span><span class="c1 c9">.

Columbia and Jefferson Avenues, the breakfast spot Lopez is on the corner of Hawley Street and Jefferson Avenue. Next door was Jefferson Manor, a shabby, dingy blue apartment complex, aka &ldquo;the shooting gallery.&rdquo; I come here, go next door, and up the stairs. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inside, as soon as I walk in, the hallway is covered with used syringe needles, burnt cotton, and beverage tops. You got works! Spikes is a name used by the junkies for needles. &ldquo;Yes, three dollars, two for five,&rdquo; was my response as I walked out of the building watching junkies lean over with needles still in their arms.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I remember thinking why were they always tired talking to me and nodding. At eleven the big picture never dawned on me. But like all-star athletes, I looked up to and admired the pushers and the hustlers in my hood. Fancy cars and beautiful women and jewelry shined and twinkled in my eyes. At eleven years old I wanted to shine. There were no lawyers or doctors to look up to, no successful people of honest means. My world was hustlers and dope fiends and the street number men. In my world everything was a hustle. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My mother did her best. God bless her soul! There were five of us, four her own. My first cousin&rsquo;s mother passed so my mom took him and raised him like her own. She tried to raise five children in the jungle all on her own. My father was murdered when I was twelve, and my mom worked swing shifts, A, B, C, which left us a lot of time to get mixed up in the streets. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Growing up the notorious housing projects, FIGHT Square, West Main Street, was called &ldquo;The Hoe&rsquo;s Stroll,&rdquo; street prostitutes, pimps, pushers, and fiends ruled women with violence and addiction. 64 FIGHT Square was my address, a front row seat to the streets. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1 c8">[</span><span class="c1 c8 c5">In the 1960s, the FIGHT Square apartment complex was built in response to efforts of a grassroots civil rights organization of the same name that worked for &ldquo;Freedom-Integration-God-Honor-Today&rdquo;. More recently, FIGHT Square was replaced by Anthony Square, a showcase of attractive affordable housing that consists of some 45 apartments and 30 single-family houses.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1 c13"><a class="c16" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id%3D8589943724&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464746259115000&amp;usg=AFQjCNERbWFyPCa9vkLUa3whokM30WzH7g">http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589943724</a></span><span class="c1">]</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In 1982 my father was murdered. I can remember feeling like I didn&rsquo;t want to be a &nbsp;burden on my mom as I watched her struggle to provide for me and my brothers and sister. It was a hopeless effort to keep us out of the streets. It was impossible when the streets were right outside our door. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before my dad&rsquo;s death he was a hustler. His brother, my uncle, taught me everything. My dad&rsquo;s &nbsp;brother, my older cousin, and then me. It was hard for this life to miss me. By the time I was thirteen I graduated to dealing marijuana and cocaine power in the era of freebase. From needles to crack pipes, I watched my world transform from nodding junkies to zombie base heads. At thirteen this was my world. It was hard for me to imagine that any other world existed. In my world I was overshadowed in misery. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;1.5 &nbsp;Million Missing Black Men&rdquo; &ndash; showed that more than one in every six black men in the 24 to 54 age group has disappeared from civic life, mainly because they died young or are locked away in prison.

I thought having my own money would ease the burden on my mom. When she punished me, it gave me more time to write my poetry. My mom read my poetry from time to time. She asked me why it was so dark and black. She said, &ldquo;Baby, there is more to the world than what you see.&rdquo; I told her there was no more to the world for me. Now I understand why she took us on trips, travelled a lot herself, and always encouraged us to see as much of the world as we could. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I ended up consumed by the streets, I always had the ability to imagine another reality.
