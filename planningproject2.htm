				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Planning was
				the focus of the first year of the partnership, 2005 �
				2006. The Planning Project had three components: </span></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial">
					A project-based, arts integrated pilot classroom project;</span></li>
					<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial">
					Professional development; </span></li>
					<li>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial">
					Curriculum development. </span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The
				project-based, arts integrated pilot classroom project consisted
				of three self-contained modular units, each with a
				self-contained curriculum designed to meet the needs of a
				transient population. In the first unit four classes of students
				/ inmates worked with writer, scholar Dale Davis. In this unit
				Davis worked with the students / inmates reading and discussing
				the lesson plans researched and written for the unit, studying
				the themes in the literature presented in the lesson plans,
				discussing assignments. The student / inmates wrote in response
				to the assignments and revised their writing for a CD and
				publication. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">For this
				first modular unit of the pilot program, Davis created a new
				poetic form, the poetic fugue, as a poetic form to address the
				academic needs of the transient population of a jail classroom:&nbsp;
				literacy, the ELA standards,&nbsp;the narrative structure, short
				attention spans, and themes. The poetic fugue was created to
				enable the students / inmates to compose a sustained piece of
				writing consisting of separate sections. Each section is
				complete within itself, while it also contributes to a longer
				piece through interwoven themes. Hip-hop beats are the thread
				that binds the separate sections together. The structure of the
				poetic fugue fuses the individual sections while it,
				simultaneously serves as a Baedeker, a guidebook to the lives of
				the young men whose childhoods have been lived in the system and
				who came of age locked-up.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The second
				modular unit built upon the writing the students / inmates did
				in the first unit. The four classes of students worked with
				musicians and engineers Jeremy DeGroat and Jeffrey Lewis
				learning music software to teach them to use the latest
				technology to produce original music, hip-hop beats, to enable
				them to improvise musically for transition in their writing. The
				student / inmates were able to demonstrate competency using the
				skills of blending, scratching, and juggling in their original
				beats. A CD was recorded following the second unit. The CD will
				be released in early November 2006.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The writing
				of the students / inmates was submitted to <i>The Beat Within</i>,
				<a href="http://www.thebeatwithin.org/news/">
				<font color="#000000">www.thebeatwithin.org/news/</font></a> published by the Pacific News
				Service and was included in three issues, Volume 11:26 / 27,
				Volume 11:28, Volume 11:29. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the third
				modular unit, the students / inmates worked with theater artist
				Louis Moreno. The students / inmates collaboratively decided
				upon a theatrical presentation, wrote the presentation, and
				performed it. Moreno divided the students into teams: writers,
				actors, and visual artists. This unit culminated in a
				performance attended by all student / inmates, Sheriff�s
				Deputies, the Monroe County Sheriff, and ten invited guests from
				the community. Following the performance the ten invited guests
				from the community were invited to sit down and talk to the
				students / inmates about the production and about their
				participating in Arts, Literacy, and The Classroom Community.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The number
				of students / inmates in the four classes varied for the three
				modules and within each module, as the amount of time the
				students were in the Monroe County Jail and able to participate
				was determined by the justice system, arrest, awaiting, trial,
				serving a sentence. Approximately 100 student / inmates
				participated in the Planning Project. Average attendance for the
				student / inmates was eight days per module. Three students /
				inmates participated in the three modules and approximately
				twenty students participated in two of the modules.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
				<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The
				Professional Development Component consisted of sessions for
				Teaching Artists on an overview of The New York State Literary
				Center, ALCC, and Rochester City School District�s Youth and
				Justice Programs by Dale Davis, Executive Director of NYSLC, and
				Margaret Porter, Program Administrator, Rochester City School
				District�s Youth and Justice Programs, both members of ALCC�s
				Steering Committee; a tour of Monroe County Jail and an
				introduction to working in a correctional setting by Edward
				Ignarri, Director of Rehabilitation, Monroe County Sheriff�s
				Department, and a member of the ALCC�s Steering Committee; A
				presentation on arts integrated education in a correctional
				setting by Frank Dody, Principal, and John Cates Curtiss, Vice
				Principal, Island Academy, Rikers Island; a planning session at
				the Monroe County Jail with the teachers participating in ALCC.
				Three members of the Project Team also attended Empire State
				Partnership�s Summer Seminar
